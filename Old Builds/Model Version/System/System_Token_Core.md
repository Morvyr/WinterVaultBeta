# ðŸ§¾ System Token Core â€“ ARX Canon Tag Manifest

This file acts as the central registry of all canonical classification tags, resonance fields, structural markers, and symbolic designations used by ARX and stream-based auto-classification.

## ðŸ”– Canonical Tag Definitions

```yaml
tags:
  CRIMSON: "Used for vault-classified mythic records requiring Crimson Ranger oversight."
  SHRIEK-BELT: "Orbital debris field of Nexovar. Emits live sonic resonance and glyph distortion."
  ZHURO-CORE: "Planet or object housing active Zhur field harmonics or sealed glyphs."
  LATTICE-NODE: "Orbital module or system anchor point tied to Ranger recruitment and Seedflow origin."
  VAULT-PULSE: "Location where vaults sync with harmonic timers or planetary waveforms."
  GLYPH-VAULT: "Any vault or archive corridor locked via memory glyph or harmonic echo."
  STAR-WEIGHT: "Defines stellar gravitational intensity and its system-scale effects."
  SEED-ORIGIN: "Node of Ranger initiation, Lattice imprinting, or echo-marked birthplace."
  ASSEMBLY-SEAT: "Governance structure regulating law, diplomacy, or myth preservation (e.g. Solarii)."
  FORCE-COMMAND: "Location where RMF and RIF upper commands reside (e.g. Caldrax)."
  INDEX-NODE: "Archive or moon where glyph fragments are stored, sorted, and echoed (e.g. Aransas)."
  FIRST-PILLAR: "Site linked to the original Zhur beacon that seeded the Forge."
