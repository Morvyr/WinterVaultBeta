## CANON – Harmonized Record

### 🌌 Classification
- **Name:** Lyvianne
- **Type:** Planetary Moon
- **Primary Orbit:** Nexovar (formerly Carenthos)
- **Environment:** Jungle-paradise surface, unstable Zhur-active underground
- **Function:** RMF and RIF headquarters; Ranger proving ground
- **Status:** Operational; partially uncontrolled

### 🌿 Environmental Layers
- Surface: Wild, untamed jungle teeming with semi-sentient life
- Underground: Chaotic Zhur tunnels, unstable resonance chambers
- Core: Pure Zhur mass, untouched due to catastrophic destabilization risk

### 🧬 RSAD Profile
- Zhur presence in core emits complex harmonic shielding, protecting Lyvianne’s orbit
- Cave systems display **living waveform behavior**
- Core harmonic pulse is synchronized with Nexovar's atmospheric frequency, stabilizing the Shriek Belt

### 🛠️ RSID Infrastructure
- Limited to low-emission surveillance nodes and deep-rig monitoring
- No stable orbital platforms due to resonance fluctuation
- Subsurface Zhur flows cause frequent mapping drift

### 🚖 RIF Oversight
- RIF-OU: Manages blackzone patrol and intelligence coordination
- RIF-SU: Conducts deep biological and resonance surveys
- RIF-LU: Manages stealth infrastructure drops and retrievals
- Constant contact with native resistance groups required for safe operation

### ⚔️ RMF Deployment
- Lyvianne is the **training ground of the Rangers**
- Recruits undergo survival rites in the wild zones
- RMF-CU (Civil) and RMF-OU (Ops) divide control between surface and underground
- RMF operates from modular lattice stations in low orbit and treetop command nests

### 🔐 Vault & Zhur Tags
- **Crimson Access Only:** True nature of Zhur core remains classified
- Known to emit **resonant dreams** influencing untrained Rangers
- Artifact sites buried under jungle contain glyphs matching First Pillar waveform

## MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

### 🌪️ The Singing Core
- Said to “sing in silence” when storms clear across Nexovar
- Rangers who sleep too close to the core are said to never dream the same again

### 🔮 The Jungle That Watches
- The native ecosystem exhibits signs of near-conscious coordination
- Some plants have been known to mimic distress signals or mirror Ranger speech patterns

### 🧬 The Forgotten Species
- A nearly-conscious native civilization existed before Ranger arrival
- Constant guerrilla war preserved by Force Command as a training mechanism
- Some believe this species was once the stewards of the Zhur core

### ✨ Lyvianne’s Legacy
- In initiation chants, Lyvianne is “the breath of the Belt, the cradle of fire”
- It is believed that **every Ranger who passes its rites** is forever attuned to the system’s resonant harmony
