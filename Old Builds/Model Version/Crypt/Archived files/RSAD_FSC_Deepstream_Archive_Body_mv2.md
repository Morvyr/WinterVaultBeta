## ⚖️ I. RANGER COMMAND (RC)

### A. Overview
Ranger Command governs the Forge through the Assembly of Admirals. It is not a military order but a ritual-conductive, law-preserving administrative body shaped by legacy, myth, and memory.

- The **Assembly** includes 300 elected Admirals.  
- At the heart is the **Hollow Seat**, a resonance-reactive chair that never holds the same voice twice.  
- **The Cradle Light** shifts to crown one chair with prophetic sanction.  
- Each Admiral is flanked by a **Marshal of the White Line** and a **Justicar**—living embodiments of memory and judgment.

### B. The Watch
- The Watch is RC’s internal continuity force. They track resonance history, prevent corruption of glyph records, and operate between systems.
- Marshals of the White Line are its spiritual arm—guardian witnesses bound to protect Assembly will.

### C. Crimson Influence
- RC does not command CR, but they **believe they do**.  
- CR acts only when the Chorus affirms RC’s command—**an intentional deception dating back to the Fifth**.

## 🛡️ II. RANGER DIVISIONS

### 1. RCU – Civil Unit
- Enforces peace in the Forge outside the capital.  
- Each RCU Ranger is issued two deputies—this triad mimics the First Ranger’s ride.  
- RCU Rangers are rural, frontier lawkeepers; in cities, they act as detectives inside DROD stations.  
- Yearly convention on Aransas solidifies doctrine.

**Ranks**: Initiate → Ranger → Marshal  
**Cultural Notes**: Each Marshal of the White Line was once a rural RCU ranger.

### 2. RMF – Martial Force
- Main military arm.  
- Operates through orbital lattices (Lyvianne) and regimental deployments.  
- The Valley = Tactical zone. The Range = Civil protection.  
- RMF Rangers are highly structured. Promotion to Admiral is meritocratic.

**Subdivisions**: CU (Civil), OU (Operations), SU (Survey), LU (Logistics)

---

### 3. RIF – Intelligence Force
- Surveillance, covert operation, glyph investigation.

- No public rank ladder

- Rival to CR without knowing it

- Houses the Justicars—singular judges who **can override Assembly rulings** if the system's integrity is at risk.

**Subdivisions**: Licensing (RCD-L), Trade/Transit (RCD-T), Internal Oversight (RCD-INT)

---

### 7. CR – Crimson Rangers
- Born from the Fifth’s rebellion.  
- Operate in shadows, tied only to the **Chorus High Council**.  
- They do not retire. They either vanish, ascend, or are sealed.  
- Rumored to be the **deputies of the Fifth Son**, all memory-wiped and glyph-bound.

**Core Prophecy**: *“Their watch ends when the Sixth rises.”*
