# 🔭 CANON LAYER – Harmonized Knowledge

## Physical Profile
- Surface of polished desert stone and silicate glass.
- Day side reaches ~1100°C; night side drops below -180°C.
- Known as “The Glare” due to dangerous reflectivity.
- Trace metallic vapors, plasma-charged wind layers.

## Visibility
- Brightest planetary body in the Forge.
- Can cause retina burn if viewed directly without lens-dampening.
- Emits auroral feedback during orbital alignment with the Emberline.

## Orbital & Material Anomalies
- No moons; plasma eddies encircle it periodically.
- Glass surface composed of Ashglass (Zhur derivative).
- Ashglass is a key component in initiating interstellar resonance engines.
- Probe Threnos-8 captured monolithic glass obelisk emitting harmonics.

## Observation Protocol
- Observation restricted to unmanned AI-controlled probes.
- Manned craft prohibited past Harenae.
- Retrieval of material subject to Crimson inspection.

# 🕯️ MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

## “The World That Burns From Within”
> “Its glow is not from heat, but from memory.”
- Belief that Thalos is a burnt shell of a pre-Forge world.
- Some see Ashglass as fossilized resonance memory.

## The Obelisk – “The Lock”
- Referred to as a beacon or anchor tied to Drift signals.
- Might be a failsafe for reactivating resonance structures in a galactic collapse.

## Ghostwatchers
- Reports of light-formed entities walking across Thalos’ glass fields.
- Possibly illusions, refracted Zhur echoes, or AI hallucinations.

## Naming Origin
> “It was Thalos that named the system. Crimsun burns. But Thalos reflects.”
- The term “Forge” was assigned later, after Crimsun was better understood.
- First Rangers thought Thalos was the system’s central power due to light scatter.

## Cultural Warning
- URP locked access beyond Shard Drift.
- All information involving Thalos is monitored and rarely shared outside CR tiers.
