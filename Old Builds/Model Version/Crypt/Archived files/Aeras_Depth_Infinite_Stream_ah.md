# 🕯️ MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

## “The Soundless Moon”
> “It hears all. It speaks never. A ghost’s ear. A watcher’s bone.”
- Considered a memory recorder of the Forge
- Pilots report precognitive dreams when entering approach vector

## Ghost Orbit Theory
- Orbit never altered; quantum ping returns static location
- May not be orbiting naturally—dimensional anchor suspected

## Vault’s Whisper
- Tone heard by CR-clearance Rangers: harmonic, not acoustic
> “It is not a vault. It is a heart that forgot it was alive.”

## Crimson Signal Echo
- Crimsun flares trigger Vault glyph pulses
- Glyphs match those found on the First Pillar
- Aeras may translate raw resonance into usable form
