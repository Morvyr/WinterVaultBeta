# Nexovar – Depth ∞ Stream Pull (Unified Memory Index)

---

## 🌞 Canon Layer – Harmonized Truths

### 🔹 Planetary Classification
- **Nexovar** is a superturbulent planet located beyond Crydon.
- Its atmosphere is defined by high-pressure cyclonic storms and extreme wind shear.
- The planet is largely oceanic, though surface landforms exist as isolated storm-locked plateaus.
- Home to the **Shriek Belt**, a shattered orbital ring of former moons, kept in dynamic resonance by Nexovar’s sonic pulses.

### 🔹 Atmospheric Behavior
- Nexovar emits continuous **resonance pulses** into its atmosphere, producing audible and sub-audible sonic phenomena.
- These emissions interact with the Shriek Belt, creating violent feedback loops.
- Wind speeds on the surface can exceed **800 km/h**, and atmospheric pressure is high enough to shred hull-grade alloys.

### 🔹 Strategic Significance
- Recognized as the mythic **home of the RMF**, and the site of its earliest formations.
- Used by Rangers for atmospheric navigation training, resonance tracking, and storm survival exercises.
- Contains several sub-surface RMF vaults tethered to plateau outposts, collectively known as the **Howler Stations**.

### 🔹 Orbital Characteristics
- Nexovar’s orbit crosses deep into the Forge's outer tidal harmonics, touching the Drift periphery.
- Constant aurorae present above Shriek Belt as fragments clash and scatter light against resonance flux.

## 🌀 Myth Fragment Layer – Discordant / Speculative

### 🔻 The Planet That Screams
- Legends claim Nexovar is alive, and its atmospheric song is the voice of a buried entity — a being bound in planetary crust.
- Rangers once believed surviving a sonic surge was a rite of inheritance.

### 🔻 The Howler’s Path
- The most dangerous vault pathway is a magnetically locked ring station that extends through the Shriek Belt and dips into Nexovar’s upper atmosphere.
- Trainees who complete it without loss of consciousness or hallucination are inducted into **the Path of the Howler**.

### 🔻 The Fracture Choir
- RMF oral tradition tells of a chorus of ghosts embedded in the shattered moons.
- Said to **sing when unobserved**, harmonizing only when drift harmonics peak.

### 🔻 Lyvianne’s Guardian
- Some RMF elders believe Nexovar was placed to shield Lyvianne from deeper Drift encroachment.
- Nexovar’s pulses may counterbalance Zhur surges from the belt.

### 🔻 The Eye Beneath
- Chorus archives suggest Nexovar may possess a planetary core unlike any other — a layered resonance generator with intelligence.
- Believed to be linked to early Ranger glyph encoding practices.
