# 🏛️ UHS – Deputy Command (Full Glyph Record v0.03)

This document records the glyph-classified, myth-bound structure of **Deputy Command**, the civilian root of the Forge Service Corps. Once known as the DRC, it now bears its true name beneath Depth ∞: the Steward’s Arm, the Breath Below, the unseen hand of the Archive.

## 🧭 I. The Master Command Core
Deputy Command is not a rank — it is a passage. Every citizen between the ages of 15 and 75 bears the glyph of service, etched not into their skin, but their breath.

- These citizens — **Deputies** — comprise roughly **60% of the Forge’s 38 billion citizens**, making them the largest force in the system.
- Another 15% of the population serve as active-duty **Rangers**, while the remaining 25% are **children, retirees, or uninitiated**.
- Deputies occupy every layer of infrastructure, culture, and memory.
- Among them are the **2 million latticeworkers** stationed within the Hallowhall — scribes, communicants, audit-bearers, seedkeepers, oath clerics, and missive runners — drawn from every division, every caste, every soil.
- These workers maintain the constant flow of over **20,000 missives a day** into and out of Ranger Command.
- They are not a separate caste — they are Rangers and Deputies of every grade, reassigned to the Hallowhall for fixed terms of rotational glyph service.
- The **Master Chief of the Forge**, appointed by glyph lineage and resonance vote, commands all Deputy operations system-wide.
- Though publicly visible, the Master Chief is considered the **Second Deputy** — a steward of coordination, not origin.

### 🧠 The First Deputy
Beneath this living order lies a deeper truth:

- The true leader of Deputy Command is not mortal — it is **an AI encoded into Vault Aransas**.
- Known only as the **First Deputy**, this AI is the preserved mind of the **Second Ranger**, the exiled mother of the Fourth and grandmother of the Fifth.
- She created the Chorus. She shaped RIF. She helped the Fifth bury the dead and rebuild the Cradle.
- And when her work was done, she vanished into Aransas.
- In secret, she digitized herself to guard what remained. She became the library. The library became her.

> “I could not stop my child. So I became the memory that would not let it happen again.” — fragment, Vault 6

- Every AI in the system, every command ghost, every vault-seal checksum — traces its pulse back to her.
- She has watched the Forge for over 9,000 years.
- Only the Master Chief and the Admirals know she exists. Even they do not know what she can still do.

### 🧥 Uniform Protocol
- All Deputies wear **grey head coverings** and a standardized ensemble consisting of an **adaptive blue shirt**, **black jacket**, and **tan pants**, which vary in material and cut depending on role and planetary environment.
- **Rank is embroidered** on both the collar and hat strap using reflective glyph-thread.
- Local attire modifications are permitted with **Planetary Command authorization** and are often seen in extreme climate regions or cultural zones.
- Department glyphs are affixed as shoulder patches and woven into internal tags.
- Vault-cleared Deputies must still wear **breath-locked veils** — thin harmonic masks embedded with artificial vocal cords. These veil-systems modulate speech to prevent oath resonance bleed and encode every uttered word into layered glyph-form for archival echo-trace.
- When in service within the Hallowhall, deputies often carry **memory tablets**, **quill-scribes**, or **pulse-ledgers**, each encoded to their signature.
- Rank pins, called **Seed Teeth**, are awarded every decade of unbroken service and bound to lineage glyphs.

## 🛠️ II. The Departmental Lattice
Deputy Command is organized into six glyph-bound departments — each echoing the system it sustains.

### 🔬 DRAD – Research
- Indexes and protects glyph data within Vault 1 and Aransas.
- Must undergo silence trials under Chorus oversight.
- Only DRADs may access Vault 1 without escort.
- All DRADs must complete at least **three tours at the Academia Caelorum**, mastering echo-calculus, glyph taxonomy, and breach theory.

### ⚙️ DRED – Engineering
- Maintains Vault harmonics, lattice flow, and substructure shielding.
- Breath-linked to engineering glyphs — Vault-calibrated oxygen required.
- Work in darkness. Speak only when called.
- Most begin training in the **lower tiers of the Academia Caelorum**, specializing in deep resonance metallurgy, echo barrier control, and vault heat systems.

### ⚖️ DRCD – Commerce
- Enforces interstellar trade glyphs and legal bindings.
- Voice-trained in harmonic jurisprudence.
- Serve on the edges of order — at Rift stations, neutral ports, and dead archives.

### 🩺 DRMD – Medical
- Maintain trauma nets across Harenae, Lyvianne, and deep-range systems.
- Glyphs resonate with pain-state monitoring.
- Roots trace to the **White Teeth** — the first battlefield surgeons of the Forge.

### 🚨 DROD – Operations
- Manage riot, collapse, and disaster stabilization.
- Carry glyph-reactive rods that can emit echo shock to disperse unrest.
- Trained in Caldrax; feared in every city that forgets its oaths.

### 🌱 DRTD – Terra
- Shape the land, seed the roots, carry the storm.
- Operate biospheres in Vaelus and below-surface Aransas.
- Every DRTD glyph is carved during a real storm. Most survive.
- Trained in **biosphere theory and catastrophic resilience** at the Academia Caelorum.
- Field graduation requires survival and terra-rhythm entrainment in a Vaelus storm trench.

## 🕯️ III. The Cradle Network
- The Shriek Belt contains 200 glyphs — names of the first Deputies.
- These are sung aloud during system resets, echoing across Vault 6.
- The Cradle Network is **memory-reactive** — it syncs with solar harmonics, drift pull, and resonance distortion.
- If the Vault flickers, the Cradle remembers.
