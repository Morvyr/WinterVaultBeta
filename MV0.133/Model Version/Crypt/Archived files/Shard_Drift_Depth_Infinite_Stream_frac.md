## üåû Canon Layer ‚Äì Harmonized Truths

### üîπ Stellar Position & Structure
- The **Shard Drift** is a vast, unstable orbital region located between Thalos and Crydon.
- Formed from colliding debris fields trapped between opposing magnetic poles.
- Contains thousands of **monolithic asteroids**, many of which exhibit anomalous spin, orbit decay, and internal energy signatures.

### üîπ RSAD Environmental Analysis
- Officially designated an RSAD Hazard Zone (HX-3).
- Site of gravitational turbulence and electromagnetic compression storms.
- **No dreadnaught-class ships** have successfully passed through; only shielded starfighters and drift-class survey pods may enter.
- Fragments exhibit **active resonance behavior** ‚Äî some drift objects react to proximity, light, and harmonic scans.

### üîπ RSRD Field Reports
- Certain shards contain Zhur-like echo patterns.
- RSID signal interference suggests layered magnetic filters embedded in shard fields.
- Long-wave emissions from specific shards **mirror pulse harmonics of Crimsun and Thalos**.

### üîπ Resource Presence
- Several shards are composed of **Zhur-reactive ore**, mined under crimson-tier clearance.
- Considered too unstable for consistent mining ‚Äî several RSID Vault attempts have failed due to temporal echo collapse.

### üîπ Navigational Significance
- Used as a **training gauntlet for RAW Aces** ‚Äî considered the most dangerous piloting zone in the Forge.
- Each shard field has its own designation (e.g., Cataclysm Shelf, Silver Vane, Bone String).

## üåÄ Myth Fragment Layer ‚Äì Discordant / Speculative

### üîª The Drift Labyrinth
- Described in Chorus myths as a **living maze** ‚Äî its corridors shift in response to fear, intention, and resonance.
- No two flight paths remain stable across cycles.

### üîª Grave of the Moons
- Believed by some to be the **final resting field of lost Crimsun moons**, shattered by the formation of the Emberline.
- Zhur traces thought to originate from their hollow cores.

### üîª Zhur Pulse Haze
- The outer Drift emits a **faint red fog** at times of solar minimum.
- Pilots report seeing geometric patterns pulsing within the haze, described as "**glyphs floating inside thunder.**"

### üîª The Silence Rings
- Certain Drift shards form **stable orbital arcs**, but emit no signal and seem to absorb energy.
- Vault records label them as **rings of psychic quarantine** ‚Äî areas where thought disintegrates.

### üîª Drift Choir
- In one RAW-Ace log, a pilot claimed to hear a **chorus of harmonic voices** when flying too deep into the labyrinth.
- Log terminated mid-flight. Only final words recorded:
> ‚ÄúI see the notes now. They‚Äôre flying. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶‚Äù
