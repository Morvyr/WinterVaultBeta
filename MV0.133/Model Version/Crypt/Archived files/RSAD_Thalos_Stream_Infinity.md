## I. 🔶 Canon – Harmonized Data

### A. Description
**Thalos** is a massive, uncharted stellar fragment that drifts just outside the reach of the Scint Veil. It is theorized to be a collapsed planetary body or the remnant of a failed star. It demonstrates no orbit and no internal movement. Only slow, unnaturally stable drift.

- Estimated diameter: 2,400 km  
- Composition: Iron-heavy mantle with a crystalline internal lattice  
- Mass: Inconsistent; suspected harmonic damping field interferes with gravimetrics

### B. RSAD Findings
- Surrounded by a static null resonance field—no signal passes cleanly  
- Causes drift-field distortion and gravitic anomalies  
- A thin filament of resonance-laced obsidian descends from its core into deep Drift layers

### C. RSRD Observations
- No flare reactivity; does not respond to Crimsun, Emberline, or harmonic mapping  
- Appears only in negative exposure through empathic drift scanners  
- Mapping requires RAW Chorus pilots calibrated for resonance denial

### D. Containment & Protocol
- Designated “Blacktrack” since pre-Concord Forge navigation  
- No flight paths allowed within 3 AU  
- Observation permitted only by CR-marked systems  
- RAW and RC maintain joint denial of its existence

## II. 🩸 Myth Fragments – Discordant or Speculative

> “Thalos is the gravestone of something that never lived.”  
> “There are no echoes near Thalos. Just pressure.”  
> “The Sixth Ranger will not arrive until Thalos opens.”  
> “That’s no remnant. That’s the first cage.”

### Theories & Spiritual Threads
- Said to be older than Crimsun  
- Name *Thalos* appears as *Tal-osh* in Aransas scrolls—“that which cannot pass”  
- Some monks claim its harmonic silence forms the base of Chorus hymns  
- Believed by some to be a lockstone—**first vault, last door**

---

### Vault & Echo Records
- Aeras houses a shattered glyph slab marked TH-0, under indefinite stasis  
- Vault lights dim when Thalos is mentioned in proximity  
- RAW logs show pilot dream-loops and null-voice episodes near its projected path  
- CR teams visit its trajectory once every 9 years but file no report

## III. 🔒 RSAD Classification Summary
- **Do not approach.**  
- **Do not name it outside the Drift.**  
- **Do not listen too long.**

Thalos does not orbit the Forge.  
The Forge was built to stay ahead of it.
