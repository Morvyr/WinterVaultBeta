# 🔭 CANON LAYER – Harmonized Knowledge

## Physical Profile
- Tidally locked: Day side is molten; Night side is frozen.
- Terminator band hosts constant storms and pressure extremes.
- Primary geological feature: Twilight Maw (global canyon belt)

## Habitation & Extraction
- Habitable zone located along the Canyon Belt (terminator)
- Shield Pylons and orbital relays preserve atmosphere
- Khytrium-rich lakes form near the terminator during seasonal shifts

## Energy & Transport
- Orbital pylon bridge ("The Spireline") links Harenae to moon Aeras
- Used for atmospheric charging, lightning rail transport, and pylon syncing
- Primary node: The Lighthouse station on Aeras

## RSID Infrastructure
- Shield Pylons deflect radiation, maintain environment
- Each industrial canyon zone has dedicated energy grid
- Managed by RSID and RCD grid control groups

## Khytrium
- Volatile starship fuel
- Appears as liquid-crystal lakes on terminator line
- Refined only under high-resonance control fields
- Mining is unmanned; all workers remote-controlled from Aeras

# 🕯️ MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

## “The Cracked Tongue of the Sun”
> “It spoke once. The ground melted. The stars ran.”
- Suggests artificial tectonics or resonance seeding long ago
- Echoes Zhur pulses from Lyvianne

## The Spireline Path
- Known as "The Ladder" in Ranger oral tradition
- RMF trials may include lightning-sprint across pylon route

## Canyon-Echoed Hymns
- Basalt fractures create untraceable vocal tones
- Only occur during resonance flare cycles
- RCD personnel call it “the hum of the burning choir”

## Myth of the Glass Wound
> “When Crimsun breathes, Harenae bleeds.”
- Miners leave ash stones beside lake edges for spiritual protection
- Khytrium collection zones called "Woundfields"
