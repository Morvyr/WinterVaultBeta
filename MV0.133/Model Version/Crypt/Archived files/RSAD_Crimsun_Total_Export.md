# ☀️ RSAD – CRIMSUN — TOTAL CANON EXPORT

## 🔶 1. Core Identity
- Primary star of the Anvyr system, designated CR-0
- Mythically central but not religiously worshipped
- Classified by RSAD as an anomalous stellar object
- Acts as a resonance anchor and narrative axis for the Forge

---

## 🌀 2. RSAD / RSRD / RSID Findings
- Emits low-frequency sonic resonance flares every 13–17 days
- Flares align with:
  - Cradle Light intensification
  - Drift harmonic spikes
  - Vault pulses on Lyvianne
- Crimsun features:
  - Thirteen-layered concentric resonance shell
  - Self-correcting inner harmonics
  - Possibly guided drift manipulation
- RSID restricts resonance drive spooling within 2.5 AU

---

## 🔭 3. Observational Infrastructure
- Vessel Array 7-A (Caldrax Ring): Temporal lens and pulse stabilizer
- Echo-Line Monitors (Drift Edge): RAW pilot harmonics
- Harmonic Vault Cores (Solarii, Aeras): Store encoded flare data

---

## 🔻 4. Mythcanon (Depth 6)
- “The Cradle Light is not a reflection. It is a wound. And it remembers who broke it.”
- “He left through the core. Not into death, but into correction.”
- “The sun sings in a language we do not speak—but the Marshals do.”
- “Crimsun does not burn. It binds. What else could hold the Veil in place?”

Associated with:
- Last known transmission of the First Ranger
- Linked to the Hollow Seat, Drift, and Marshal glyph harmonics

---

## 🔐 5. Restrictions & Rituals
- No resonance spooling within 2.5 AU
- RAW flyby restricted to glyph-coded clearance
- The Watch oversees all solar research attempts
- Marshal glyphs originate from flare matrixes

---

## 🧭 6. Associated Objects
- Cradle Light
- Hollow Seat
- Solarii
- The Scint Veil
- RAW Pilots (flaring response cycle)

---

## ❌ 7. Absent / Unconfirmed
- No named temple or Chorus orbital installation
- No flare-linked Zhur exposure events
- No planetary forging or ejection cycle myths confirmed
