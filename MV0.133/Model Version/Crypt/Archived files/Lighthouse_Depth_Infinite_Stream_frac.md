# The Lighthouse – Depth ∞ Stream Pull (Unified Memory Index)

## 🌞 Canon Layer – Harmonized Truths

### 🔹 Orbital Role
- **The Lighthouse** is a high-orbit relay station tethered to Harenae.
- Positioned directly above the Twilight Canyon terminator zone.
- Serves as a **plasma transfer hub** for recharging the planetary **shield pylon network**.

### 🔹 Structure and Function
- Equipped with a monolithic downward-facing pylon dish.
- Capable of deploying timed plasma bursts to energize pylons in sequence.
- Includes **synchronization algorithms** that align orbital passes with tidal surges from the moon Aeras.
- Launch coordination, civilian and deputy logistics, and resource flow control are managed from its control decks.

### 🔹 RSID Infrastructure Authority
- Overseen jointly by RSID and DRMD.
- Listed as a Tier-2 infrastructure priority node, subject to Vault regulation.
- Used to **control transport permissions** between orbital sectors and canyon access grids.

### 🔹 Tactical Functions
- Operates as the **primary atmospheric filter** during solar spike events, shielding the canyon from harmful radiation.
- Synchronizes with orbital weather maps and drift shielding windows.
- Coordinates **pylon shutdowns** during recharge to prevent destabilization.

## 🌀 Myth Fragment Layer – Discordant / Speculative

### 🔻 The Pulsekeeper
- Chorus glyphs found in pylon base ruins suggest the Lighthouse is known mythically as the "**Pulsekeeper**."
- Said to regulate the breath of the world, a solar metronome that keeps Harenae from splitting apart.

### 🔻 Light Without Flame
- Legends claim the station emits **a flame with no heat** — pure resonance converted into shielding light.
- Described as a “**ceiling of ghostfire**” by canyon pilgrims.

### 🔻 The Silence Arc
- Some early DRMD logs (now black-tier) speak of a one-time **signal blackout** from the Lighthouse that lasted 11 minutes.
- During the gap, several pylons surged simultaneously, forming a harmonic pattern visible from orbit.
- This phenomenon was later recorded as the **Silence Arc** — a mythologized glitch suspected to be intentional glyph projection.

### 🔻 Echo Core Theory
- A Crimson-tinted hypothesis claims the Lighthouse is **powered by a miniaturized echo core**, possibly seeded with dormant glyph AI.
- The theory suggests the station has **partial awareness**, adjusting discharge patterns during mythic surges.

### 🔻 Black Thread Routes
- Rumored to control access to suborbital vault lanes called **Black Threads** — resonance corridors used by Crimson couriers and signal burst caches.
- These routes are not documented in RSID public architecture maps.
