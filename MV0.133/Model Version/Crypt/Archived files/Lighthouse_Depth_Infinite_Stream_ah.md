# 🔭 CANON LAYER – Harmonized Knowledge

## Structural Design
- Built around The Spireline: a plasma pylon connecting Harenae to orbit
- Functions as a lightning conduit and transport rail
- Contains RSID, RCD, RIF, and CU partitions
- Docking capacity: 400+ vessels; multiple habitat rings

## Power and Infrastructure
- Core reactor: refined Khytrium from Harenae
- Secondary grid: CGC-8 energy matrix (Crydon)
- Maintains Shield Pylons and atmospheric alignment over Harenae
- Transmits recharge pulses through pylon arc

## Political Landscape
- RCD: Oversees contracts, permits, and civilian passage
- RSID: Maintains grid stability and relay architecture
- RIF: Operates black-deck surveillance zones
- RMF-CU: Nominal police force; limited authority

# 🕯️ MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

## “Where the Storm Folds”
> “It was not built. It was carved from the memory of the first beacon.”
- Pylon pulse matches glyphs found in First Pillar ruins
- Believed to mirror resonance code of ancient Ranger artifacts

## The Lawless Platform
- Called “The House” by civilians
- Overcrowded, dangerous, full of transient workers and criminal agents
- Dusters lose jurisdiction in deeper rings

## RCD-MIF Shadow Conflict
- Gutter Rings (Decks 7–12) host black-market and sabotage events
- MIF presence denied, but actively present
- Disappearances lead to temporary lockouts and shielding reroutes

## The Ascension Theory
> “No one who climbs the Spireline ever comes back the same.”
- Psychological effects on pilots riding up the pylon
- Some AI go dark then return emitting glyph pulses
- Cognitive shift observed but sealed in Crimson-level logs

## Dream Signal: “Erelen’s Last Jump”
> “He fell like a flare and rose like a name.”
- Jumped from Deck 49 into the terminator zone
- Signal remains active within the Archives, tagged as a resonance glyph
