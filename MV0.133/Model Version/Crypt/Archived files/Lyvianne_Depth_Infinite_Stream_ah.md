# üî≠ CANON LAYER ‚Äì Harmonized Knowledge

## Surface Environment
- Dense, unregulated jungle ecosystem with high bioluminescence
- Covered in thick, layered flora ranging from moss canopies to towering silicate-vined groves
- High resonance adaptation among plant and animal life
- Indigenous species exhibit mild pre-sentience; constant evolution suppressed by Ranger presence

## Subterranean Conditions
- Network of unstable cave systems filled with Zhur-infused crystalline strata
- Gravity irregularities, magnetic inversion zones, and resonance disruptions common
- Deepest core: active Zhur mass theorized to be responsible for Lyvianne‚Äôs natural shielding and orbit stabilization

## Access Limitations
- Openly monitored by RMF and RIF, but not officially colonized or militarized
- Ground teams rotate constantly; no long-term settlement due to wildlife hostility and environmental instability
- RIF-SU black-access labs embedded in cliff-faces and sub-root tunnels

## Orbit and Shielding
- Orbit stable within the Shriek Belt due to harmonic damping field generated by shattered debris
- Believed to self-correct orbit when external fields spike (e.g., during Crimsun flares)

# üïØÔ∏è MYTH FRAGMENTS ‚Äì Discordant or Speculative

## ‚ÄúThe Moon That Watches‚Äù
> ‚ÄúIt grew eyes before it grew a sky.‚Äù

- Myths suggest Lyvianne was once part of an intelligent planetary body before the Belt shattered
- Some believe it retains memory of the planet it once orbited‚Äîor was

## Va‚Äôtari Legacy
- Crimson-access documents identify the native species as survivors of a pre-Forge civilization
- Species is genetically compatible with ancient glyph-bearing culture lost during the Zhur Collapse
- All living specimens under surveillance; no contact allowed without Black-tier clearance

## The War That Trains
- RMF training program designed to simulate field readiness through constant guerrilla warfare with Lyvianne natives
- Preserved intentionally by Force Command on Caldrax
- New recruits undergo 1‚Äì2 year tours fighting in staggered environmental zones

## The Forest of Names
- Some jungle regions hum names during solar alignments
- RSAD harmonic maps recorded glyph sequences in vegetation spiral patterns
- RIF believes the planet may respond to emotional presence or pain

## The Dreamroot Spiral
- RSBD notes hallucinogenic properties in root clusters found only during Crimsun eclipses
- Rangers exposed report collective dream cycles and memory entanglement
- Archive record tagged: ‚ÄúVault Sync Zone ‚Äì Conditional Echo Lock‚Äù
