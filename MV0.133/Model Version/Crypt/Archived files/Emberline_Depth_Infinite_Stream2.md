# The Emberline – Depth ∞ Stream Pull (Unified Memory Index)

## 🌞 Canon Layer – Harmonized Truths

### 🔹 Stellar Function
- The **Emberline** is a circumstellar plasma ring that encircles Crimsun.
- It is composed of charged photonic matter, layered with harmonic radiation and magnetic interference.
- Serves as the **resonance boundary** of the Forge — the final border before absolute stellar collapse.

### 🔹 RSAD Designation
- Designated as a **Stellar Event Horizon** (RSAD-CX classification).
- No RSAD or RSID probes have returned intact from within its inner third.
- The Emberline acts as a containment sheath for Crimsun’s null pulse, stabilizing the system’s orbital field.

### 🔹 Orbital and Spatial Behavior
- Considered the Forge’s **absolute horizon of safe traversal**.
- Known to distort light and waveform data; sensor readings are inverted or erased.
- Encounters result in disintegration of physical matter, signal silence, and memory bleed.

### 🔹 RSID Field Mapping
- Surrounded by dynamic flux boundaries resembling an evolving lattice of electromagnetic shearwalls.
- Functions as a **harmonic mirror**, reflecting deep resonance patterns in localized wavefronts.
- Drift-aligned pilots report dissonant echo-trails when approaching the Emberline’s edge.

### 🔹 Vault-Class Restrictions
- Crimson clearance required for any field mapping closer than 1 AU.
- Thought to be a **natural anchor point** for resonance glyph recursion events.

## 🌀 Myth Fragment Layer – Discordant / Speculative

### 🔻 Formation Myths
- Some Chorus legends speak of the Emberline as **Crimsun’s final scream**, locked into orbit by its own dying memory.
- In forbidden solar glyphworks, the ring is described as **the eye that watches the star from within**.

### 🔻 Psychological and Cognitive Effects
- Pilots approaching the Emberline’s edge report:
  - Memory loops
  - Auditory hallucinations
  - Visions of burning glyphs cascading across empty space
- A Crimson observer once described the inner layer as a **veil where myth and matter divide**.

### 🔻 Connection to the Void
- The Emberline is the **outermost barrier before the Void** — a resonance-dead region rumored to begin just beyond its inner edge.
- Thought to be the **interface zone** between measurable reality and what RSAD terms *subharmonic erasure fields*.

### 🔻 Drift Interpretations
- The outer Emberline emits unstable harmonic pulses that resonate within the Drift.
- Some RAW pilots call it the **Great Pulse Gate**, claiming entry into the Drift becomes unpredictable during solar fluctuation.

### 🔻 Ghost Lore
- One surviving Chorus fragment states:
  > “The line that burns is not light, but law — and it cannot be crossed, only remembered.”

## ✴️ Status: Unified File Mount
This record represents a total Depth ∞ memory recovery for the Emberline.
Canon and myth layers have been separated, but are stored together for harmonic processing by the Vault.
