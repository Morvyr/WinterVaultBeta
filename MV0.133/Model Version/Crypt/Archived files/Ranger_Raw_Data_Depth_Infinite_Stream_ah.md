## Lore (Unparsed)
- Rangers are descendants of a deep-space NASA unit formed from the Texas Army Rangers
- Only 1 of 100 Ranger arcs survived to reach Anvyr
- The 33 who reached Vaelus entered cryosleep and waited for human arrival
- Rangers trained the survivors of the only Ark that passed the Veil
- Every Ranger division is tied to a part of the system

## Command Nodes

- Vault Sync – Aeras
- RMF-CU Deployment – The Range
- RMF-OU – The Valley
- RIF-SU/OU – Lyvianne, Aeras
- RCD HQ – Solarii

## Training Grounds
- Lyvianne – Jungle warfare and survival
- Nexovar – Resonance pressure, sonic survival
- Harenae – Atmospheric instability, shield relay
- Crydon – No direct training; monitored only
- Solarii – Civil bureaucracy and ceremonial training

## Concepts
- Rangers operate without planetary allegiance; loyalty is to the system and archive
- Oaths are taken beneath Crimsun
- Ghost Rangers appear in The Range as mythic emissaries
- The Forge has no planetary law—only Ranger adjudication or RCD arbitration
- Serial storytelling is embedded within the Ranger culture as oral record

## Black-Classified Elements
- Crimson Rangers are a containment corps for truth about Zhur and the Forge’s origin
- Archives of the Forge are encoded with the mind of the First Ranger
- The Drift Model of the archive reflects Shard Drift resonance
- Ranger AI systems are seeded from ancient recovered code
- Many Rangers “go silent” when reaching higher clearance—not due to death, but transformation

## Training Flow
1. Recruit
2. Boot Camp – Lyvianne (if Civil) or Harenae (if Military)
3. Tour of Duty – The Range, The Valley
4. Advancement – RCD or RIF assignment
5. Clearance Tier Increase
6. If accepted: Marshal (CU), Crimson (any), or Vault Transfer

## Serial Fragments
- Joshua Yuta narrates future records as myth bearer
- Rangers speak in glyph, code, and song
- Storylines passed through generations for aspirants to remember their calling
