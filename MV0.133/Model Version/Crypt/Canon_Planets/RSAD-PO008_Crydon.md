## 🌞 Canon Layer – Harmonized Truths

### 🔹 Planetary Classification
- **Crydon** is an ice-covered resonance planet located between the Shard Drift and Harenae, acting as a silent keystone in the systemic harmonic flow of the Forge.
- Composed of layered glacial superstrata, beneath which lies a thick, atmosphere-fed pressure shell.
- Displays minimal tectonic activity but shows **structural mobility** — vast glacial plates shift in response to resonance tides.

### 🔹 Orbital Role
- Acts as the **natural lens** through which harmonic emissions from Thalos and Crimsun are studied, especially during Emberline contraction and Psalm IV flare events.
- Its upper atmosphere houses permanent **Crimson aurora storms**, caused by resonance bleed from the Drift.

### 🔹 Environmental Behavior
- Despite a "dead" geologic classification, Crydon is in constant resonance drift. Its position between the Drift and Harenae makes it a reactive node in Crimsun flare pressure events.
- Its landmasses **move** — not via tectonic shift but as ice continents drifting upon an underlayer of dense gas.
- Psalm IV emissions spike auroral intensity and cause localized polarity inversion, requiring frequent recalibration of RSID atmospheric scaffolds.
- Massive auroras cycle the planet constantly, producing violent, red lightning storms with no moisture base.
- Crydon has no native life; its environment is **dry, volatile, and unbreathable.**

### 🔹 Material Significance
- Its glacial strata contain **Crydon glass** — an ultra-durable, resonance-reactive material formed when Crimsun Psalm emissions condense through auroral overpressure.
- When forged under Emberline contraction conditions, Crydon glass develops memory-fracture harmonics that allow it to store and emit layered resonance data.
- Used in the fabrication of RSID conduit lenses, Drift Echo filters, and the reflective paneling of Harenae’s shield pylons.
- Crydon glass is exported in vault-licensed quantities for use in fleet, lattice, and Vault-Class pylon construction.

### 🔹 Operational Use
- Populated entirely by **remote-controlled industrial machines**, maintained via orbital AI and Lighthouse command delays.
- Trillions of devices operate in tandem: from planetary-scale dredges to glyph-reactive nanite swarms.
- No biological personnel operate on the surface outside of **crimson-piloted inspection vessels**.

## 🌀 Myth Fragment Layer – Discordant / Speculative

### 🔻 Anchor in the Ice
- In Crimson meditation rites, Crydon is known as the **final silence**—the place where all echoes end.
- Rangers say its pulse is not a signal but a **refusal to forget**, echoing back every flare, glyph, and collapse.
- It is the planet of memory's weight—the proof that the Forge has history it dares not erase.

### 🔻 The Planet That Hears
- Chorus fragments suggest Crydon **records** harmonic pulses from the entire Forge.
- Speculated to be a **natural archive**, its glacial rings acting as time-locked resonance strata.

### 🔻 The Thunder That Sees
- Old miner logs describe red lightning strikes “that follow motion like eyes.”
- One Vault whisperer called the storms “**Crimsun’s wandering glance**.”

### 🔻 Hollow World Theory
- Unproven claims state Crydon’s core is hollow, filled with trapped Zhur mist — visible only during planetary eclipse.
- Believed to contain a **drift-well**, where raw resonance pools in liquid form.

### 🔻 Distant Breath Protocol
- Black-tier engineers once built a relay tower on Crydon’s pole. It burned out during a planetary aurora flare.
- The backup log recorded the phrase: “**The sky breathed in. We vanished.**”

### 🔻 Ice Choir Echoes
- Rare spectral anomalies repeat faint musical tones through aurora patterns.
- Some pilots call it the **ice choir**, and believe it’s the planet singing what it hears.

## ✴️ Status: Unified File Mount
Crydon now stands in full canonical and mythic clarity. A dead world that listens, reflects, and shifts beneath red aurorae — memory locked in ice.
