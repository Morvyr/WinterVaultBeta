## ✴️ Canonical Record (Depth ∞ Pull – Harmonized)

### 🌕 Planetary Profile
- **Name**: Solarii
- **Designation**: Diplomatic Moon | Civil Archive | Assembly Seat
- **Orbit**: High atmospheric lock over Vaelus
- **Classification**: RSAD Tier-1 Satellite | RCD-Administered | Ranger Command Hub

### 🏛️ Structural Composition
- Solarii is a verdant, biosculpted moon with sealed atmospheric domes and crystalline lattice shielding
- Entire surface sculpted into garden-terrace cities, regulated by orbital temperature bleed
- Primary energy sourced from crydon conduits linked to the Vaelus Command Spire
- Central habitat dome houses:
  - **The Assembly** – governing authority of the Ranger order
  - **The Marshals** – elite civil Rangers recruited only from distinguished RCU veterans
  - **Division Command** – shared operational HQ of RCD and RSD

### 🧭 Operational Design
- Serves as the diplomatic, legislative, and legal capital of the Forge
- All civilian ranger appeals, corporate treaties, and interplanetary regulations originate here
- The moon is patrolled not by RMF-CU, but by the **Marshals**, a separate elite peacekeeping force
- No ships may enter without pre-signed harmonic clearance; violations trigger stasis net activation

### 🧠 RCD Administrative Sectors
- Licensing Bureau (RCD-L): Issues Forge-wide permits for mining, settlement, and Vault access
- Trade & Transit Authority (RCD-T): Coordinates export lanes and refueling routes through the Veil
- Internal Oversight (RCD-INT): Handles Conglomerate infiltration, contract violations, and blackmarket suppression

## 🔮 Myth Fragments

### ✨ The Moon That Forgave
- Solarii is said to contain the only unburnt record of the original Arcs

### 🛡️ The Silent Court

- Members hear the beat beneath their name before they ever speak

### 🦉 The Marshals’ Vigil
- Marshals do not sleep — their dreams are archived
- Solarii glows when they judge, dim when they doubt
