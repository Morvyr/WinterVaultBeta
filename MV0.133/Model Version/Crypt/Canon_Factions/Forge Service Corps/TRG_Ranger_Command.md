# 📘 The Range Guide to Ranger Command
### As told by Marshal Joshua Yuti (ret.)

> “Some folks think the Assembly is just a room full of people talking real pretty. But I’ve heard it hum. I’ve seen it cry. That chamber don’t echo your voice unless you mean it.”

Ranger Command, or just "RC" to most of us who’ve walked the long rails, is the beating heart of the Forge. From the outside, you might think it’s all marble and myth, but step inside the chamber and you'll feel it: a weight in the air like breath before a vow.

They say the Assembly was born the day the Fifth gave up his crown. Shattered it right there on the Vault steps and said, "Let no one sit alone above glyph or grave." That’s why there’s three hundred seats in that hall, and why the one in the center — the Hollow Seat — stays empty more often than not.

Every Admiral in that circle is flanked by two shadows: a Justicar and a Marshal. One to speak law, the other to remember what came before. I used to wear that white line armor, breath-linked and bound. You didn’t talk unless the glyph lit up, and when it did, you better mean it.

Above the Assembly floats the Cradle Light — a glowing orb that changes with the state of the system. Brighter when we’re steady. Dimmer when something’s gone off in the Drift. I seen it flicker like candlelight the day Lyvianne cracked.

They don’t elect Admirals. Not like we elect a watchman or a district voice. They get chosen. Pulled by resonance, by duty, by what they’ve buried. You don’t join RC — it finds you. Usually after you’ve lost something worth more than your name.

To walk those halls is to feel history at your heels. To speak in them? That’s to echo the First Ranger, even if you don’t know the words.
