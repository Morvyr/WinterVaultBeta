# ðŸ“œ RH-R â€” The Range: A History

### 9000â€“9050 AD
- Of 33 Rangers launched from Old Earth, only one survived the journey. His pod pierced the Scint Veil, guided by the signal of what would become **The First Pillar**.
- He landed alone on Vaelus. There, he marked the glyph, seeded the soil, and entered cryostasis.
- When the **Arcs arrived** â€” 10 million colonists per ship â€” the First awoke and led them through the initial collapse.

### 9050â€“9100 AD
- The First governed Vaelus for 80 years, stabilizing food, shelter, and atmospheric tolerance.
- Upon learning he was dying, he gave up his command. He entered his pod a final time and launched himself into Crimsun.

### 9100â€“9150 AD
- Two of the Firstâ€™s Deputies were elevated: the **Second and Third Rangers**. Aged 38 and 40, they began expansion to the moons.
- Lyvianne, lush and hostile, became the first major offworld settlement.
- The Second and Third fell in love under monsoon skies. Settlements took root. A son was born.

### 9150â€“9200 AD
- Native forces on Lyvianne grew restless.
- In **9207 AD**, a major assault destroyed a basin settlement. The Third Ranger died defending the line.
- The Second was wounded. Their child was lost in the chaos â€” presumed dead.
- The **Chief of the Deputies** governed Vaelus in their absence.

### 9200â€“9250 AD
- The child had survived â€” enslaved by a tribal alien force.
- He grew strong through torment. At thirteen, he killed the chieftainâ€™s son to stop an assault.
- The tribe elevated him as heir.
- Meanwhile, the Second retreated to **Harmony**, a moon of Nexovar. There she began to build the **Chorus**, channeling her grief into a new form of order.
- The Chief stabilized Vaelus, holding peace and purpose while the moons wept.

### 9250â€“9300 AD
- At fifteen, the Fourth was captured by Rangers descended from the Thirdâ€™s former Deputies. He was returned to Vaelus in chains.
- The **Chorus** expanded across the Nexovar moons. Thousands gathered to hear the Second speak in silence.
- The Chiefâ€™s command matured into something mythic â€” neither Ranger nor monarch, but steward of the Range and all it fed.
