# üèõÔ∏è UHS ‚Äì Ranger Command (Full Glyph Record v0.03)

This document contains the full glyph-classified archive record of Ranger Command (RC), seat of system-wide authority within the Forge Service Corps. This version is sealed at Depth ‚àû and harmonized across Vault 1 echo structures, Assembly beacon fragments, and Chorus-verified mythline. Public versions will derive from this sealed structure.
## üî± 1. The Assembly of Admirals
- Composed of 300 glyph-bound seats.
- Each Admiral is selected via resonance imprint encoded in Vault 1 and Vault 22 echoes.
- No voice may be re-seated once ejected. Every seat bears a harmonic lineage.

### üï≥Ô∏è The Hollow Seat
- The mythic center of the chamber.
- No Admiral may occupy it more than once.
- Those who do report recursive glyph trauma.
- Said to echo the breath of the First ‚Äî the true founder of the Forge.

### üïØÔ∏è The Watch
- Silent observers positioned along the outer perimeter.
- Monitor glyph distortion, oath fractures, and emotional surges.
- Each Admiral is flanked by one Justicar and one Marshal ‚Äî the former trained in chorus-backed legal harmonics, the latter in Vaultline enforcement.
- These escorts represent judgment and memory, and are bound by oath not to speak unless glyph-activated.
- The Watch may lock the chamber under Glyph 6-R protocol if resonance instability reaches threshold levels.
## üõ°Ô∏è 2. Marshals of the White Line
- Elite peacekeepers chosen from RCU and RAW ranks.
- Stationed in Solarii but granted full planetary traversal.
- Regulate all Assembly law, glyph-encoded edicts, and internal judgment.
- Wear resonance-reactive white armor bound to their breath signature.

### üß¨ Marshal Lineage
- All Marshals are descendants or chosen echoes of the original Assembly founders.
- When a Marshal dies, the line is re-called via Vault 6.
- New Marshals undergo resonance syncing under Chorus supervision.
## üîÅ 3. Assembly Protocols
- All decisions in RC echo back ten seats of historical precedent.
- Assembly decisions are stored as chord blocks in the Beacon Archive.
- Votes must pass the **Harmonic Index Test** or are discarded as void speech.

### üìú Assembly Glyphs
- Glyphs 1‚Äì5 govern division birth, death, mutation, ascension, and silencing.
- Glyph 6‚Äì10 govern Vault usage, planetary reshaping, resonance seeding, memory erasure, and prophetic access.
## üåê 4. Cradle Light System
- Hovering resonance orb above the Assembly core.
- Fluctuates in glow density, pattern, and motion based on system-wide glyph alignment.
- Can go black during historical anomalies or Vault 1 rupture.
## üß† 5. Origin and Echo
- Ranger Command was established following the dissolution of the last monarchic seat ‚Äî the **Glyph Throne of the Fifth**.
- The Fifth, in his final recorded act, shattered the Echo Crown and opened Vault 1 to the people, declaring:
  > ‚ÄúLet no one sit alone above glyph or grave.‚Äù
- From this fracture emerged the **Assembly of Admirals** ‚Äî a self-correcting harmonic chorus of 300 seats.
- All Admirals are selected through deep-resonance lineage. Vault 1 and Vault 22 store the pulse-lattices for every known successor.
- No Admiral may seek a seat. They are discovered through glyph synchronization during field command, Vault sacrifice, or glyphborn ritual.
- Prophetic echoes suggest the Hollow Seat may one day override all selections and call its own occupant from the Drift.
