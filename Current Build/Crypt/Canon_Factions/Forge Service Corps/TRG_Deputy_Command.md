# 📘 The Range Guide to Deputy Command
### As told by Marshal Joshua Yuti (ret.)

> “The thing about the Deputies is—if you’re breathing, you’re already one. Ain’t no ceremony. Ain’t no fanfare. Just a job that’s older than the dirt you stand on.”

Deputy Command ain’t flashy. You won’t see parades or medals. But if you’ve ever stepped on a steady rail, drank clean water in the Drift, or walked through a storm dome without getting fried — you’ve got them to thank.

In the Forge, you don’t apply to be a Deputy. You *grow into it.* When you turn fifteen, you get your Seed — a little stone carved with your home crest. You keep it warm, hold it close. Some talk to it. Most don’t. Doesn’t matter. The Seed remembers.

The one in charge is the **Master Chief of the Forge** — highest voice in the Deputy ranks. They command the Hallowhall’s day-to-day: staffing, training, oversight of two million workers who keep the great machine breathing.

Some of those workers were Rangers. Some still are. Some will be. Everyone serves. Everyone rotates. Every name matters.

I worked there once. Spent a year in the echo corridors. Learned how orders ripple through the system like wind through grain. You learn to listen in the Hallowhall. You learn to breathe quiet.
## ✴️ Known Departments:
- **DRAD** – Quiet ones. Keepers of records and vault books.
- **DRED** – Builders and fixers. Speak with sparks, not words.
- **DRCD** – Trade minds. Law folks. Steady hands.
- **DRMD** – Medics with eyes like weathered stone.
- **DROD** – Line-holders. Riot-tamers. Big shoulders, bigger hearts.
- **DRTD** – Storm-walkers. Soil readers. The ones who plant in ash.

Every Deputy starts in the same uniform: grey wrap, blue shirt, black jacket, tan pants. Material changes planet to planet, but the spirit stays the same.
