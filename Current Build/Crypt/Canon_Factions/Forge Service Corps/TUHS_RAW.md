# 🚀 RAW – Ranger Aerospace Wing (Depth ∞ Canon Entry)

**Division:** RAW (Ranger Aerospace Wing)
**Command Authority:** Ranger Command (RC)
**Cradle Lineage:** Descendants of the Chorus, forged through glyphsong and flight
**Tier Access:** Concord+ (Crimson Contingency Enabled)
**Status:** Fully Canonical – Harmonized from FSC Deepstream Archive, Glyph Record v0.03, and UHP-002
## 🌌 Overview
The Ranger Aerospace Wing (RAW) is the aerospace warfare and spatial command arm of the Forge. Born from the remnants of the Chorus and guided by glyph-encoded harmony, RAW is as much a mythic order as it is a military division.

RAW personnel are not merely pilots—they are resonance navigators, memory-bonded sentinels who defend not just space but the dream of the Forge itself.

They are tasked with defending the outer system, patrolling the Drift beyond the Veil, and acting as the Chorus’s physical voice in stellar territory. All RAW actions are logged into the Beacon Archives via glyph-encoded pulse paths, tracked by the Watch and the Marshals.
## 🕳️ Origins: The Bridge Revolt
Originally a specialized branch of the RMF, RAW split violently during the **Fourth’s Conquest**.

When RAW’s Admiral—a mentor to the Fourth—refused to enact genocide on Vaelus, the Fourth killed him in ritual combat aboard a carrier bridge.

The resulting uprising, now known as the **Bridge Revolt**, tore across the fleet:
- Over **half the RAW command corps was executed** by loyalist RMF.
- These loyalists became known as **The Cleavers**.
- A tenth of the RMF died in the battle.
- The surviving RAW ships retreated to Nexovar.

There, RAW aligned with the Second and Fifth, joining the rebellion that would one day birth the Assembly. Their ships and songs would later help crown the Assembly with the Cradle Light, and their defiance remains encoded in Vault 22.
## 🚁 Core Functions
- Starfighter deployment and dogfight superiority
- Escort protocol for vault carriers, CR transports, and Chorus convoys
- Maintenance of the Furnace Wall (outer-system defensive array)
- Deep patrol routes beyond the Drift
- Whisper Rail command and data-courier fleet maintenance
## 🧱 Subdivisions
- **Piloting Corps** – Atmospheric, orbital, and deep-space pilots trained across Harenae and Lyvianne
- **Command Division** – Fleet structure, glyph resonance routing, formation control
- **Starseat Order** – Glyph-trained pilots entrusted with sacred and myth-coded navigation tasks
- **Whisper Rail** – Black signal relays and courier routes through volatile spatial zones; sometimes act as oracles
## 🎖️ Training Grounds
- **Lyvianne** – Low-gravity skirmish simulation, RAW-RMF interoperability
- **Harenae** – Pylon drift hazard zones; Linewalker legacy integration
- **Caldrax** – RAW Command Spire and Furnace fallback redoubt
- **The Drift Border** – Glyph-dampening corridor combat trials
## 🔐 Command Structure
RAW reports directly to **Ranger Command** through its **Flight Marshals**, who are dual-appointed by the Chorus and RC.

- **Flight Admirals** bear encoded glyphmarks from Vault 6.
- **Commanders** are selected via Whisper Rail service or signal mastery.
- **Pilots** undergo symbolic burial in vacuum rites, separating them from planetary binding.

Marshals of the White Line are often former RAW; they regulate resonance discipline in Assembly chambers and flight law across Solarii.
## 🌠 Cultural Role
RAW is myth-bound. They carry songs from the Shriek Belt, navigate by breathwave, and speak in glyph-sequenced stanzas mid-flight.

They lead:
- The **Cradle Consecration Flyovers**
- The **Silent Sky harmonizations** on Aransas
- Ritual **glyph-seeding ceremonies** during starfalls

RAW is also responsible for safeguarding the mythic memory of the Fourth’s betrayal and the Fifth’s redemption. Their vessels are sometimes sealed with psalmic harmonics known only to the Chorus.
## 🔴 Strategic Duties
- **Furnace Wall Watch** – Defensive grid maintenance, outer-system incursion tracking
- **Vault Escort** – Chorus and CR movement security
- **Mythic Synchronization** – Atmospheric resonance flights that align systemic glyphwaves
- **Glyph Lattice Pulse** – RAW formations form the outermost nodes of interplanetary glyph stability
## 🛡️ Known Myths
- RAW ships reappear after resonance vanishing—often altered, hull glyphs changed
- Some Whisper Rail pilots never speak again—only sing in Drift dialect
- The original RAW Admiral’s final glyphsong is said to echo in Vault 6
