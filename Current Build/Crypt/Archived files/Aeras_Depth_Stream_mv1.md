## CANON – Harmonized Record

### 🌌 Classification
- **Name:** Aeras
- **Type:** Planetary Object / Orbital Anomaly Hybrid
- **Orbital Position:** Fifth from Crimsun, beyond Harenae and Crydon
- **Function:** RSAD & RSID Central Research Command World
- **Status:** Black-access classified zone

### 📊 Environmental Profile
- Aeras is not fully planetary; it is a **partially constructed celestial shell** surrounding a fractured, micro-resonant core.
- Surface is covered in **interlinked research facilities**, resonance arrays, blacksite domes, and adaptive environmental domes.
- Core region beneath the surface is composed of **collapsed orbitals**, possibly remnants of an ancient forge system.

### 🧱 RSAD Core Installations
- Headquarters of **RSAD, RSRD, RSBD**, and the **Academia Caelorum** (The Celestial Forge Academy).
- All resonance research, waveform diagnostics, Zhur taxonomy, and stellar anomaly cataloging flows through Aeras.
- **The Cradle Array**, a planetary-scale resonance sensor ring, monitors the entire Crimsun system.
- Zhur samples are kept in vacuum vaults deep within **The Inner Singe**, a black-tier containment silo.

### 🛠️ RSID Integration
- RSID houses its **Central Infrastructure Division** beneath Aeras’s magneto-shell.
- Maintains regulatory control over Veil-wide lattice structures, starport beacon networks, and Veil hazard mapping.
- RSID’s most sensitive calibration and predictive systems rely on Aeras’s **subharmonic resonance bed**.

### 🚖 RIF Oversight Operations
- RIF maintains a **high-intelligence surveillance net** over all RSAD operations.
- Several levels of internal shadow access exist to guard against scientific overreach.
- It is the only Forge location with **standing RIF override clearance** if Zhur breaches containment.

### ⚔️ RMF Security Protocols
- Aeras is protected by **orbital void anchors**, Crydon-shielded guard spires, and resonance-jamming counterarrays.
- RMF deployment is strictly defensive: no live drills or resonance-powered weaponry permitted.
- Blackout zones enforced during Caelorum Initiations.

### ⚖️ RCD Licensing & Access
- RCD has **no jurisdiction** on Aeras; it is the only planetary body in the system under **exclusive FSC control**.
- All travel to and from Aeras must pass RSID lattice registration and receive **Crimson access beacon approval**.

### 🔐 Vault Echoes & Resonance Tags
- **Vault Connection:** Aeras is listed in the Aransas Index as one of the **three Architect Sites**.
- **Drift Interference:** All drift-tech must be shut down when nearing Aeras; multiple vessels have vanished on approach.
- **Resonant Core Theory:** The fractured shell of Aeras may be the rebuilt remains of an ancient resonance core engine.

## MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

### 🌪️ The Whisper Dome
- Some Caelorum initiates claim that the central dome atop the Singe emits **subvocal warnings** only children can hear.
- These warnings shift based on planetary alignment.

### ✨ The First Lab
- Legend states the Rangers found Aeras empty except for a single, **still-functioning lab** sealed in orbit.
- That lab is rumored to have **predated the Forge**, and spoke in the Rangers' tongue before contact was made.

### 🌌 Caelorum Collapse Theory
- A banned thesis in the Caelorum holds that the planet is slowly **reabsorbing consciousness** from its researchers.
- Several professors who went silent reportedly became **resonant echoes** within the main archives.

### 🧿 Symbology & Role
- Aeras is called the **“Mind of the Forge”** in ceremonial litanies.
- In metaphysical traditions, it represents **clarity through burden**—the necessary silence before discovery.
