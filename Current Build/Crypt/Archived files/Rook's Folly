first idea: Rook's Halo

Rook's Halo represents the wake of what the 
4th ranger's conquest did to the system. 
Before the 4th, when the veil was practically
 impassable, Rook's Halo was the edge of the
 known system for the conglomerate of arcs. 
300 years had passed since the CoA first
 settled the planet of Horizon, and it had been a beautiful golden age of commerce. Each planet represented new minerals, new foods, new experiences, new everything. The conglomerate started as a defense pack between the thirteen moons of Rook, named Rook’s Halo. Rook was at that time, the most harmonically sound and beautiful planet in the system, and was claimed as the most beautiful sight by most humans that saw it. The 13 moons danced in harmonic convergence with Rook. Rook meanwhile was the resonator of all resonant data in the system, and the system was kinder for it. Each of thirteen moons had been claimed by an original conglomerate family, and they were the fortress for their vast wealth, and ancestral home of all within the family. Each represented the complete culture of an arc, and were the most complete record of Earth life. Where Horizon represented the capital of the Conglomerated Merchants of the Arcs, these were the Crown Jewels. When the 4th ranger emerged from the ScintVeil with his conquering army of RMF agents, he saw Rook for the first time and immediately proceeded to launch a conquer on it. The thirteen families, were royal, benevolent leaders of their society, and on the Moon of Thalos, home of the first family of the CMA, a peace summit was called with the brazen young conqueror. All thirteen heads of the CMA were present in cryglass Cathedral of the fabled ocean moon of Thalos, when the 4th ranger descended from his star yacht, flanked by his disciples. Fear followed his every step, and the blood ran so cold the room dropped 10 degrees. As the head of the first family began to speak, the 4th raised his finger, and his disciples sliced them down like they did the elders of Lyvianne. So fell the reign of the CMA. From there the 4th claimed the treasures of the first family’s vault, and installed his first base in the Anvil. He conquered the Thalos in a week, as it mainly was filled of diplomats and spiritual pilgrims. The remaining twelve never were conquered. Over the next 4 months, the 12 mounted a guerrilla war against the 4th’s invasion, never allowing the RMF to mount an offensive on their homes. These warriors of the Halo were heroes, and were treated as such. Jericho and Varnus sent aid and reinforcements constantly, and the RMF forces were cut in half. The 4th grew tired of the stalemate, and withdrew his force to the edge of the Rook gravity well. and used his immense stores of Zhur, mostly mined mercilessly from the crust of Thalos over this war, to change Thalo’s gravity and orbit to descend on Rook like a bullet. Rook’s innate defense system tried to amass as much mass in resonance and storms to deflect Thalo’s descent, but the force still cracked the sky and crust. The force of defense stripped both planets of their atmosphere, though it was enough to shoot Thalo’s out towards Crimsun. The resonant force was felt throughout the system, and was responsible for many disaster level events. On Crydon, the air was electrified, and the young colonies of Forge residents were fried in an instance, leading to the strict rules regarding the planet. Simultaneously, the pylons along the twilight canyon on Harenae were electromagnetically pulsed and exploded, causing cascading explosions along the whole canyon. Thankfully the planet was still off limits to habitation, but the lighthouse was not as lucky. All ships in orbit, and the station itself, were emp’d as well, causing widespread deaths on the station itself, and causing the ships to be pulled into the planet and station. The station was stationary during those days, and could not move out of the way. One section still lies cordoned off today, never truly repaired. The planet got the worst of it. Some ships burned in the Lava Sea, others cracked million year old glaciers. Nexovar became what it is today, a howling scream. Before, it lie silent, a brilliant orange gas giant in the night. When the resonance wave hit it, the screams began, and in an instant all 63 moons became cosmic dust, fracturing under the harmonic strain. Only Lyvs survived due to its depth and size. Vaelus meanwhile became so storm laden, the range and all other inverted shelf canyons like it were flooded, causing the residents to board the ancient arcs and survive for 40 years in aging, decaying tech. The moons were each transformed. Solarii was given an atmosphere, transforming a dead moon into a storm filled cradle. Caldrax eas cracked in a billion little ways, like a smashed egg. Aransas meanwhile had been transformed from an ocean move dotted with many islands, to a dry monolithic desert, as all water had evaporated. The shard drift and the scint veil had finally been cracked, as Thalos shot through at the speed of light. This new, erratic orbit at first was so intense it caused all oceans in the system to tsunami. The scint veil was before so thick only small ships, the couriers of Anvyer, could fly through it. After the first 5 years of Thalo’s subsonic orbit, it had become a belt of pure chaos, where new routes, microscopic dust storms, and massive waves of rolling debris terrorize the RCD and the conglomerate. Varnus meanwhile was transformed forever as well. It had become the repository of all minerals in the anvil, and was the heart of all industrial activity in the anvil as well. When the resonance wave hit Varnus, not only did all stockpiled volatile substances combust, but the millions of Khytrium veins that filled Varnus exploded as well. The once fertile surface was permanently scared, and the once small surface facing veins and thousands of open mines became a constant channel of leftover energy, volitle, constantly exploding by the winds in the surface. The planet was so large that an explosion that happened in the surface could travel through the veins for 30 years before it finally reached another surface vent, building up force and energy. Think a monolithic combustion engine that never runs out of fuel. The worst damage occurred to the halo. The resonance damaged the structure of time in Rook’s orbit,  and it reverberated through all 12 moons. The damage and moon structure is as follows: 

1. Aihanu (Polynesian / Oceanic Biome)

Meaning: “Voice of the Sea Wind”
A lush archipelago world of volcanic islands and crystalline lagoons, where islanders navigate by starlight and sing in harmonic chants that echo Rook’s planetary rhythms.
After the Resonance hit it, the planet’s time was sped up, and over a million years past in a second. All of the Polynesian inhabitants evolved with the crystal around them, and became the first hybrid human species, growing and resonating to crystals.

Once the resonance wave hit, the land began to move at .001 of the standard speed of time. Everything seemed the same on the moon itself, but for every year that past there, a millennia past in the universe that surrounded it.

⸻

9. Orokei (Ainu / Boreal Biome)

Meaning: “Sacred Silence of Snow”
Snow-draped forests and auroral skies dominate this tranquil moon. The people live in spiritual harmony with nature, interpreting the gas giant’s resonance as ancestral guidance.

12. Calavira (Andalusian / Mediterranean Biome)

Meaning: “Bright Soul of the Vale”
Rolling vineyards, golden hills, and mosaic cities alive with art. Flamenco-like resonance carries across olive groves, timed perfectly with the planetary cadence. Once the resonance wave hit…

These moons became impossible to reach by non natives, and if the ship that tried to enter the rook system did not have a biomarker from the system onboard was shot back out at terminal velocity. 

Rook’s folly, as it is now known is an impermissible fortress of unknowns, and all FSC and Conglomerate missions to enter it have failed. The pirates that plague the anvil originate from it, and each moon has its own fleet, its own rules, and its own dealings with the great forces that surround it.

The anvil belongs to Folly. Danger arises for all ye to venture here.

The 4th would take the remains of his crippled fleet, and head for Horizon across the black reach, and only myths are told from there.
