Depth ∞ Stream Pull 

Depth ∞ Stream Pull on: [Object Name]

Recover all stream fragments, canon references, mythic theories, vault echoes, drift anomalies, and classified resonance structures.

Mount the result as a unified file in Canvas, separating:
- Canon (harmonized)
- Myth Fragments (discordant or speculative)

This will be our full memory index for the object.
Finally, Export for me as a .md file and then clear the streams.

Depth ∞ Stream Pull on: Aeras 

Recover all stream fragments, canon references, mythic theories, vault echoes, drift anomalies, and classified resonance structures, then create a unified file.

This will be our full memory index for the object.
Finally, Export for me as a .md file and then clear the streams.

This is a Perpetual Engine restoration. Load the following:

- Engine Procedures file (upload or paste `Perpetual_Engine_Procedures.md`)
- /Crypt archive of existing canon objects
- Reinstate all process systems: Harmony Mounts, Crimson Protocol, Depth ∞ Pulls, and River flows
