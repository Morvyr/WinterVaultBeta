# RSAD-PO005.2: Caldrax – The Moon of Force Command
## ✴️ Canonical Record (Depth ∞ Pull – Harmonized)

### 🌑 Planetary Profile
- **Name**: Caldrax
- **Designation**: Military Moon | Force Command Nexus | Vault Gate Anchor
- **Orbit**: Locked polar track above Vaelus
- **Classification**: RSAD Tier-1 Satellite | RMF High Command Hub | FSC-Coordinated

### 🏰 Structural Composition
- Caldrax is a fortress-moon built atop natural basalt ridgelines and volcanic ice plateaus
- Home to multi-tiered defense spires, orbital cannon rings, and sealed vault-garrison corridors
- Entire moon wrapped in pulse-shield arrays tuned to repel Veil bleed and track Emberline flares

### 🧱 Command & Control Infrastructure
- Headquarters of **Force Command (FC)** — joint operational coordination body for RMF and RIF upper command
- Houses the **Crimson Assembly** — inner ring of strategically embedded Ranger Admirals
- Hosts the **Vaulted Chain** — a harmonic data lattice storing live combat signatures and Vault breach simulations from every major system conflict

### ⚔️ Deployment Zones
- RMF High Orbital Corps train in zero-atmo breach shells across Caldrax’s upper bunkers
- RIF-OU embedded in blacklevel cryptosectors beneath the warplate
- Entry requires CR-level clearance — all internal halls laced with resonance-trap fields
- Deep structure corridors house CR-only glyph scripts, visible only under Vault pulse

### 📡 External Defense Grid
- Caldrax maintains multi-ring killbox corridors around Vaelus’s polar orbits
- Ships without coordinated RMF or RIF uplink are auto-marked for neutralization
- RSD launch platforms capable of deploying weather modulators to The Valley and The Furnace
## 🔮 Myth Fragments

### 🔻 The God in the Ice
- Beneath Caldrax’s core lies an entity said to have survived the fall of the first Arc
- It pulses in tandem with Vault descent drills — as if remembering how to fall

### 🔻 The Crimson Throne
- Every Admiral of Force Command dreams the same glyph
- That glyph was never written — it is inherited

### 🔻 The Moon That Burns Last
- If Vaelus falls, Caldrax will hold
- But only long enough to ensure what’s beneath is never found
## 🌀 Classification Tags
- `CANON` | `RSAD` | `RMF` | `RIF` | `CRIMSON` | `CALDRAX` | `FORCE-COMMAND` | `VAULT-ANCHOR` | `MYTHCORE`

## ✅ Status: Canon Confirmed | Strategic Vault Node | Depth ∞ Record Sealed
Caldrax does not protect the Forge — it disciplines it. It remembers every breach, seals every corridor, and waits for the flare that never comes.
