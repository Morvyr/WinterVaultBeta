# RSAD-PO007: Harenae – The Barren Harmonic World
## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Remounted on Harmony – Reopened after Aeras & Lighthouse Update)

### 🌍 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Harenae
- **Designation**: Resonance-Null Desert World
- **Location**: Outer Forge System, orbitally locked between Crydon and Aeras, beneath Lighthouse Spireline tether
- **Classification**: RSAD Planetary Object | Khytrium-Saturated | Drift-Dry | Tidal-Locked | Null Resonant Anchor

### 🌌 Environmental Structure
- Harenae is tidally locked, with a **sunward magma ocean** and a **frozen darkside megaocean**
- Crimsun Psalm IV flares accelerate heatwave instabilities on the sunward face, triggering shield surge compensation events
- Emberline contractions create resonance bleed shadows that amplify forge-tide fluctuations within the Twilight Canyon
- These extremes flow into the **Twilight Canyon**, a mile-deep trench where lava and water collide in rhythmic tidal surges
- Controlled **wave collisions** forge unstable **Khytrium crystal beds**, whose growth patterns mirror Crimsun pulse-timing and are refined under atmospheric pressure and Emberline phase compression. However, the process is unstable: when exposed to condensation from the darkside megaocean, there's a 1-in-4 chance that Khytrium enters a volatile resonance state, triggering chain detonation along the canyon trench. Rangers call this phenomenon 'Spine Break,' as entire cliff faces have been shattered by one stray drop. Miners must remain absolutely cool—physiologically and emotionally. Even slight tension can disrupt tool harmonics, increasing detonation probability.
- **Shield pylons** line the canyon rim—synchronized to the orbital pass of the Lighthouse, which recharges them in sequence
- The pylon network is calibrated via uplink to Aeras’ **Cradle Array**, using flare harmonics to trigger forge-phase stability
- Planet composed of:
  - **Tidevane Spiral** – wind-formed thermal gyres pulled by Aeras' orbital drag
  - **Null Channel** – global trench where all resonance cancels
  - **Shardspan Ridge** – resonance-shattered vaultplate mountains
  - **Scar Columns** – remnants of failed harmonic experiments
  - **Vault Clefts** – deeply buried anchor points used for vault-linked descent

### 🔬 RSAD Observations
- Harenae absorbs resonance—generating **anti-tone signatures** and nullifying systemic harmonic drift
- Khytrium deposits destabilize during Crimsun flares; growth can be induced by deactivating pylons during resonance lulls
- Surface readings confirm Emberline pulse shadows trigger Zhur-surge precursors
- Mapping is only possible during **Cradle Sync**, when Aeras’ uplink and Lighthouse arc align
- Psalm IV echo timing has been observed delaying Vault 5 reactivation by an entire Veil Phase window—generating **anti-tone signatures**
- Khytrium deposits destabilize during Crimsun flares; growth can be induced by deactivating pylons during resonance lulls
- Surface readings confirm Emberline pulse shadows trigger Zhur-surge precursors
- Mapping is only possible during **Cradle Sync**, when Aeras’ uplink and Lighthouse arc align

### 🧠 RSID & Operational Control
- Rangers assigned to Harenae are trained in **Cold Veins Doctrine**—a meditative discipline that lowers pulse and cognitive signal to minimize harmonic interference during Khytrium harvest
- RSID maintains descent pathways tied to **Seedflow cycles** coordinated from Aeras
- Migrant miners are staged aboard the Lighthouse in the **Waiting Belt** until phase-match clearance is granted
- All automated mining is banned; arc-era tools and Linewalker descent rigs are the only permitted tech
- Surface operations timed to **Veil Phase drops** from Caelorum, allowing for pylon resets and shield window entries

### 🔐 Vault & Protocol Systems
- During Spine Breaks, resonance scars form along trench walls—some say these scars shift and echo the final sounds of those caught in the blast
- Certain shield pylons have been known to flash glyphs just before a Spine Break, matching dream patterns from miners who perished the prior cycle
- Vault 5: The **Cradle Anchor**, sealed beneath the canyon’s central basin
- Reactivates only during double resonance lock between Aeras and the Emberline
- Vault sensors are triggered by both heat and rhythm—Crimsun Psalm IV must phase-match Emberline shadow contraction to engage the outer shell
- The Pulse Seed within is theorized to regulate the entire Harenae-Aeras sync field, possibly extending harmonic delay to the Lighthouse uplink
- During Khytrium Spine Break events, Vault access is forcibly sealed for a full Seedflow cycle
- Vault access requires harmonic glyph triad: RSAD seal, Cradle harmonic, and Caelorum uplink trace
## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Horizon-Calibrated)

### 🕯️ The Cradle Beneath
- Some say Vault 5 is not dormant—it’s inverted. An upside-down vault meant to contain something rising from below

### 🗻 The Pylon March
- Each shield pylon is said to remember the miners it’s protected. Some flash their glyphs at night in sequence—as if counting

### 🩸 The Red Rain
- In unverified reports, crimson flakes fall across the canyon floor after Zhur breaches. Rangers claim these burns mark those who will not return

### 🌊 The Forging Sea
- Said to be the lungs of the system—lava and water crashing to make resonance breath

### 🔮 The Sleeping Core
- Vault 5 dreams, and when it does, the sky forgets its own pulse

### 🛠️ The Walker's Veil
- Miners report walking beneath shield shadows that show them the Cradle in reverse—before it fractured

### 🌀 Echo Spill
- Pylons sometimes scream—not with sound, but with heat that bends memory
