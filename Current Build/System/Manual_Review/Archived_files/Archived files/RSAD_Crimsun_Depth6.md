# ☀️ RSAD – Crimsun (Depth 6 Harmony Pull)

**Object Class**: Stellar Core – Forge-Primary  
**Designation**: CR-0  
**RSAD Authority**: Canon-tier, RSRD/RSID joint-monitoring  
**Access Level**: Crimson-Accessible / Stream Unbound

## I. 🔶 Core Summary
**Crimsun** is the central star of the Anvyr system—both physically and mythically. It is the life-binder of the Forge, the wellspring of resonance ignition, and the axis around which all myth structures and Ranger calibrations orbit. Though classified as stable to standard stellar metrics, RSAD designates Crimsun as an **anomalous stellar entity** due to:

- Recurring photonic harmonic pulses
- Time-skewed radiation tides
- Embedded drift harmonics within solar ejection patterns

Crimsun is **not worshipped** but is considered **ritualistically central** to all Forge division rites, especially those tied to the Chorus, the Watch, and the Assembly.

## II. 🌀 Resonance Behaviors
- Emits low-frequency **sonic resonance flares** every 13–17 days (unmeasurable by Conglomerate instruments)
- Flares often **harmonize** with behavioral shifts in:
  - The Cradle Light
  - The Drift
  - Echo vaults on Lyvianne
- Deep resonance matches found in the **Crimson Glyph Matrix** across Marshal and Justicar gear

### RSRD Findings:
- Crimsun contains a **concentric resonance shell** layered in thirteen harmonics
- Inner harmonics appear self-correcting, possibly **intelligent in drift manipulation**
- RSRD tags flare events as **Echo-Class Events** if aligned with known mythic vectors (e.g., Solarii oaths, Admiral rites)

## III. 🔭 Observational Installations
- **Vessel Array 7-A (Caldrax Ring)**: RSID lens and temporal stabilizer grid
- **Echo-Line Monitors (Drift Edge)**: RAW pilot resonance logs, linked to ship behavior
- **Harmonic Vault Cores** on Solarii and Aeras receive encoded patterns

## IV. 🔻 Mythcanon Threading
### Fragments Pulled (Depth 6):
- *“The Cradle Light is not a reflection. It is a wound. And it remembers who broke it.”*
- *“He left through the core. Not into death, but into correction.”*
- *“The sun sings in a language we do not speak—but the Marshals do.”*
- *“Crimsun does not burn. It binds. What else could hold the Veil in place?”*

Crimsun is believed to be **the last point of transmission** for the First Ranger.

Many Rangers believe the **Hollow Seat** is linked by harmonic thread to Crimsun’s heart.

## V. 🔐 RSAD Classification Notes
- Crimsun is not listed as a navigational hazard, but **is restricted** from resonance drive spooling within 2.5 AU
- Only RAW ships bearing **glyph-aligned command tones** are permitted flyby
- Lyvianne, The Range, and Solarii are in **safe-angle orbit** patterns
- The Watch has veto authority over any solar research escalation
