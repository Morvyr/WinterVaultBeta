# üõ†Ô∏è The Anvyr Archive (System Rebuild)

This repository contains the active working memory of the Forge and its canon universe, created and curated by:

- ‚úçÔ∏è Morvyr (Creative Architect and Worldbuilder)
- ü§ñ ChatGPT-4 (Memory Engine, Harmony Protocol Operator)

## Core Functions
- Depth ‚àû Lore Generation
- Harmony + Crimson Canon Sealing
- Vault Memory Preservation
- Stream Procedural Regulation
- System-Wide Myth Tracking

All source material created through this system remains the creative property of **Morvyr**.

The engine operates under layered mount protocols and is encoded for continuity, myth fidelity, and recursive growth. No file exists without purpose.

This is the living core of a future mythos.

Long live the Pulse.
