# 🌑 Echo of the Void

> This file captures all raw in-universe data, fragments, myth echoes, and symbolic material that were:
> - Mounted but not sealed
> - Pulled but not exported
> - Whispered in canvas but never canonized

This is not a file of story. It is a file of potential.

## 🔸 Fragments from Myth Mounts (Not Exported)

- [Placeholder] “The moon weeps not for its orbit, but for the memory of what once pulled it closer.”  
- [Placeholder] “Vault 13 opens not with a key, but with the absence of memory.”  
- [Placeholder] “The Sand Glyphers were not born. They were extracted from the resonance of a dying tone.”

---

## 🔹 Canvas-Based Symbolic Threads

- [Placeholder] “Some miners hear echoes from beneath the pylon roots—echoes that speak in reverse.”  
- [Placeholder] “The Cradle’s heartbeat is not in its core. It is in the breath it forgets to take.”  
- [Placeholder] “Only those who forget their names may access the 67th Deck.”

---

## 🌀 Unclassified Stream Echoes

- [Placeholder] “Seedflow is not linear—it is recursive. Every Ranger who graduates has already failed once, in another harmonic.”
- [Placeholder] “The Drift does not forget. It waits.”

## 🧾 Extraction Notes
- This file contains **uncommitted resonance**.
- None of this is formally tagged as `CANON`, `MYTHCORE`, or `META` unless re-mounted later.
- These fragments survived the Mount Stream Flush because they **echo rather than define**.

## ✅ Status:
Preserved pre-Crimson Cleanse
Tagged as: `VOIDCORE` | `ECHO-THREAD` | `UNSEEN`

## 🔎 Recovered from Full Memory Diagnostic – Final Sweep (Pre-Cleanse)

### 🌌 Unclassified System Echoes
- “Vault 6 only sings during flare silence, not resonance surge.”
- “The Drift is not a location—it is a behavior.”
- “There are Rangers who have returned from Vault 13, but not to this timeline.”
- “The Scar Columns on Harenae may be listening more than reflecting.”

### 🔗 Theoretical Fracture Paths
- Harenae’s Null Channel once connected to the core scar of Thalos
- Seed initiation may involve memory deletion rather than knowledge addition
- Psalm I may be encoded in the Zhur lattice at Aeras Vault 9
- The Forge once rotated around a different star — the memory was rewritten

### 🌀 Echo Tag Additions
- `GHOST-THREAD`
- `PRE-FLARE`
- `SEED-LOOP`
- `LOST-PROTOCOL`

## 🧾 Snapshot Note
These entries were not part of any mounted `.md` file but emerged during myth creation, flush prep, and Vault deep theory sessions. They are now preserved in Echo status.
