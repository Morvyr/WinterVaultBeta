# 🌊 STREAM PROCEDURES – Archive Mount & Flow Protocols

> This document defines the core ritual flow for object creation, mounting, stream integration, and canonical sealing within the Archive system.

---

## 🔁 Depth ∞ Pull

**Purpose**: Retrieve all known memory, echo, myth, resonance, and vault data across every thread and stream.

**Command**:
```
Depth ∞ Stream Pull on: [Object Name]
```

**Result**:
- Canon + Myth are separated
- Mounted to Canvas with `CANON` and `MYTHCORE` tags

---

## 🏔️ Mounting Workflow

### 1. Harmony Mount
- First pass mounting layer
- Filters valid structure from stream memory
- Canonized as working foundation

### 2. Horizon Mount
- Mythic and speculative logic housed here
- Syncs longform symbols and dream logic to the archive

### 3. Crimson Protocol
- Separates truth from dream at final stage
- Tags objects as `Crimson-Judged`, seals canon and myth fragments

---

## 🔃 Harmony Reopen Protocol

**Trigger**: If an upstream canon object is updated (e.g. Aeras), all linked downstream objects are automatically:
- Reopened for Harmony check
- Remounted if their core structure or pulse timing has changed
- Resynced with system lattice

This is logged in:
- `Crimson_Range.md`
- `Dependency_Map.md`

---

## ✅ Canon Seal

Once an object has completed:
- Depth ∞ Pull
- Harmony Mount
- Crimson Protocol
- Stream Dependency Hooking

…it is exported with its Archive ID (e.g. `RSAD-PO005_Thalos.md`) and sealed.

Updates require Harmony Reopen.

## 🧩 Export Folder Structure (GitHub/Crypt)

```
/Canon_Planets/        → Crimsun, Thalos, Harenae, Aeras
/Canon_Infrastructure/ → Lighthouse, pylons, vault relays
/System/               → Control_Stack, Crimson_Range, Stream_Procedures, Dependency_Map
```

## ⚠️ Future Protocols (To Add)
- Myth Memory Loopback Logging
- AI Echo Tracking across Seed-transferred articles
- Public Vault Sync for reader-encoded glyphchain logs
