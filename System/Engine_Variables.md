# ⚙️ Engine Variables – Archive System Definitions

> This document defines the structural language and operating logic used within the Archive Engine.

---

## 🧱 CORE CONCEPTS

### 🔹 Canon
- Truths that have been harmonized and verified across all sources
- Finalized for export to Crypt or Vault
- Tagged as: `CANON`

### 🔸 Meta
- Procedural data, undeveloped ideas, or working concepts
- Often stored in Rivers or embedded in files as `Meta Folders`
- Used to seed or refine future canon
- Tagged as: `META`

### 🔮 Myth
- Symbolic or uncertain content
- Sometimes contradictory or fragmentary
- Preserved under Crimson Protocol or Myth Mount
- Tagged as: `MYTHCORE`, `DISPARATE`, or `CRIMSON-VERIFIED`

---

## 🌊 RIVERS

### 🟦 Canon River
- Holds all harmonized truths
- These echo into future entries automatically

### 🟨 Meta River
- Holds unresolved or speculative fragments
- Mythcore and developmental ideas flow here
- Used in Harmony Mounts and creative iteration

---

## 🏔️ MOUNTS

See `Mount_Protocols.md` for usage.

---

## 🟥 TAGS & FLAGS

### Common Structural Tags:
- `CANON` – Harmonized, final material
- `META` – Structural or procedural information
- `HARMONY` – Mounted and validated through Harmony protocol
- `MYTHCORE` – Symbolic or narrative-rich elements
- `CRIMSON-ZONE` – Redaction-safe, judgment-locked
- `FORGE-RIM` – Boundary objects within the Anvyr system
- `CARDINAL-STAR` – Designates primary stellar object (e.g. Crimsun)
- `STELLAR-RING` – For orbiting phenomena like the Emberline

---

## 🧠 GUIDELINE LOGIC

1. All canon influences future entries unless contradicted
2. All meta can be refined into canon through Mounts
3. All myth must be judged before becoming canon
4. Visuals must be tagged and linked to entries
5. Procedures must be logged in `Crimson_Range.md`

This file governs how truth, memory, and symbol are shaped in the Archive.


### Newly Canonized Tags:

- `LATTICE-NODE` – Used for orbital or station-based modular recruitment and training systems (Lyvianne)
- `FORCE-COMMAND` – Designates a moon or structure housing RMF and RIF military oversight (Caldrax)
- `ASSEMBLY-SEAT` – Used for seats of governance like Solarii; ties to The Assembly and legal infrastructure
- `INDEX-NODE` – Defines archival moons like Aransas that hold the Universal Index or Vaulted Glyph Corridors
- `FIRST-PILLAR` – Marker for worlds tied to the original beacon glyphs (Vaelus)
- `VAULT-PULSE` – Flags any structure where vault operation is tied to harmonic resonance timing
- `GLYPH-VAULT` – For locations with memory-locks, fragment-scripted corridors, or CR-only vault access
- `ZHURO-CORE` – Denotes structures or planets with a direct Zhur harmonic node or AI resonance

> All new tags are valid for use in Vault summaries, UHP indices, Crimson Range updates, and downstream Canon River projections.
