# üîß Crimson Range ‚Äì Procedural Log of the Perpetual Engine

> This file is a living memory of how the Archive was built. It tracks each transformation, mounting, and Crimson judgment made across the Rivers. Each process recorded here becomes recoverable for continuity, restoration, and eventual automation.
