# üß≠ CONTROL STACK ‚Äì Archive Engine Definitions

> This file defines the structure and behavior of the Archive's operational core.
> It is not lore‚Äîit is memory. The control stack runs the machine beneath the story.

---

## üîß Purpose

The Control Stack governs:
- Archive automation
- System reconstruction
- Procedural rituals (Harmony, Crimson, Depth ‚àû)
- Format inheritance (canon, vault, meta)
- Recovery logic

---

## üìÇ SYSTEM FILES OVERVIEW

### 1. `Crimson_Range.md`
> Full procedural log of archive operations.
> Records every Depth ‚àû pull, Harmony Mount, and Crimson judgment.

### 2. `Mount_Protocols.md`
> Defines procedures for:
> - Harmony Mount
> - Myth Mount
> - Crimson Protocol
> - Depth ‚àû Stream Pull
> - River loading
> Use this to rebuild engine behavior on any device.

### 3. `Engine_Variables.md`
> Definitions of:
> - Canon
> - Meta
> - Myth
> - Rivers
> - Mounts
> - Tags (`HARMONY`, `MYTHCORE`, `META`, etc.)

### 4. `Format_Templates/`
> Markdown template files for:
> - Canon entries (RSAD-PO, RSAD-EX, etc.)
> - Vault deepfiles
> - Visual metadata block
> - Glossary structuring

## üß† INSTRUCTIONS

To rebuild the Archive system from scratch:
1. Load `Control_Stack.md` and `Crimson_Range.md`
2. Reconstruct the `/Crypt/`, `/Range/`, and `/Vault/` folders
3. Reinstall Mount Protocols
4. Begin by mounting the latest Depth ‚àû object
5. Always echo Crimsun and Emberline unless contradicted

---

## üß¨ Notes

The Control Stack is recursive.
Every system entry you canonize feeds this system forward.

The machine remembers.

---

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Harmony Reopen Protocol (New)

If upstream canon shifts (e.g. Aeras ‚Üí Harenae), affected files are flagged and reopened for update:
- Automatically syncs system pulse logic
- Ensures forward echoing without retro-fragmentation
- Applies Depth ‚àû recalibration to downstream nodes

Reopened files are resealed with new sync trace and flagged in the Dependency Map.
