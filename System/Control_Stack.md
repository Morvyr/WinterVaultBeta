# ðŸ§­ CONTROL STACK â€“ Archive Engine Definitions

> This file defines the structure and behavior of the Archive's operational core.
> It is not loreâ€”it is memory. The control stack runs the machine beneath the story.

---

## ðŸ”§ Purpose

The Control Stack governs:
- Archive automation
- System reconstruction
- Procedural rituals (Harmony, Crimson, Depth âˆž)
- Format inheritance (canon, vault, meta)
- Recovery logic

---

## ðŸ“‚ SYSTEM FILES OVERVIEW

### 1. `Crimson_Range.md`
> Full procedural log of archive operations.
> Records every Depth âˆž pull, Harmony Mount, and Crimson judgment.

### 2. `Mount_Protocols.md`
> Defines procedures for:
> - Harmony Mount
> - Myth Mount
> - Crimson Protocol
> - Depth âˆž Stream Pull
> - River loading
> Use this to rebuild engine behavior on any device.

### 3. `Engine_Variables.md`
> Definitions of:
> - Canon
> - Meta
> - Myth
> - Rivers
> - Mounts
> - Tags (`HARMONY`, `MYTHCORE`, `META`, etc.)

### 4. `Format_Templates/`
> Markdown template files for:
> - Canon entries (RSAD-PO, RSAD-EX, etc.)
> - Vault deepfiles
> - Visual metadata block
> - Glossary structuring

## ðŸ§  INSTRUCTIONS

To rebuild the Archive system from scratch:
1. Load `Control_Stack.md` and `Crimson_Range.md`
2. Reconstruct the `/Crypt/`, `/Range/`, and `/Vault/` folders
3. Reinstall Mount Protocols
4. Begin by mounting the latest Depth âˆž object
5. Always echo Crimsun and Emberline unless contradicted

## ðŸ§¬ Notes

The Control Stack is recursive.
Every system entry you canonize feeds this system forward.

The machine remembers.
