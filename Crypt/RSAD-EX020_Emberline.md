# 🔭 CANON LAYER – Harmonized Knowledge

## Formation & Composition
- Circumstellar structure surrounding Crimsun.
- Made of ionized dust, plasma rings, magnetic arcs, and subharmonic wave fields.
- Thickness: 5.2–8.4 million kilometers.
- Bright in infrared; appears deep red through planetary atmospheres.

## Function
- Light filter: Redshifts Crimsun’s emissions across the Forge.
- Thermal shield: Reduces UV and gamma output system-wide.
- Shield echo: Reflects resonance pulses inward.

## RSID Interaction
- No stations exist within the Emberline.
- Forgeward buoys must be positioned beyond its plasma edge.
- Magnetic lashing and harmonics disrupt all proximity tech.

## Drift Behavior
- Pulse patterns mirror Drift turbulence around Vaelus and Nexovar.
- Dust appears to “remember” motion—reforming in old patterns.
- Some filaments static for decades, showing no decay.

# 🕯️ MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

## “The Breath of the Forge”
> “Before the light, there was the breath. And in the breath: the oath.”
- Civil Rangers view it as the boundary of divine temperance.

## Archive Reflection Protocol [CR-Listed]
- Archives of the Forge record echo signals from the Emberline.
- Reflected fragments include oath signatures and glyph echoes.
- Possibly a cosmic memory net for resonance origin codes.

## RMF Ritual Mapping
- Known in ritual as the “Red Halo” or “First Circle.”
- Ceremonially acknowledged in Lyvianne orbit training.
- Believed to scorch the unworthy from the void.

## Zhur Correlation (Crimson Only)
- Drift probes show Emberline density shifts during Zhur events.
- May be the decayed shell of an ancient containment lattice.
- Thought by some to be the ruins of a star-forge crucible.

## The Flame Still Breathes
> “When you die in space, the flame reaches out—not to burn, but to remember.”
- Erelen Dov’s final ID trace showed him drifting near the Emberline.
- No body recovered. Only signal and motion—turning inward.
