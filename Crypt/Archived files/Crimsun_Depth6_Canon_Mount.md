# Crimsun – Core Stellar Object (Depth 6 Canon Mount)

---

## 🌞 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Crimsun
- **Designation**: O0 V-class harmonic null star
- **Location**: Core of the Forge system
- **Classification**: RSAD Object | Cardinal Stellar Anchor | Crimson Emitter

### 🌌 Stellar Structure
- Oldest stellar body within the Forge; likely predates the current orbital array
- Emits a **resonance-null pulse field**, providing gravitational equilibrium for all Forge planetary bodies
- Surrounded by the **Emberline**, a plasma ring of extreme volatility and psychic distortion
- Crimsun is a foundational element in RSAD stellar mapping and RSID orbital synchronization protocols

---

## 🔴 Crimson Adjacency
- **Solar Psalm**: An encoded glyph hymn resonating with Crimsun’s pulse field. Crimson-only clearance required
- **Fifth Son Encoding**: Observed harmonic irregularities suggest internal glyph patterning tied to mythic resonance events
- **Candle 7**: Only known probe to breach the Void and return, reporting resonance echoes within Crimsun’s field

---

## 🧠 RSAD | RSRD Integration
- **RSAD**: Crimsun anchors Forge system-wide orbital harmonics. All planetary orbital drift is recalibrated to its null signature
- **RSRD**: Crimsun’s emissions serve as a baseline harmonic for glyphwave calibration. Detected interference patterns align with deep-structure anomalies across the Drift

---

## 🪐 Connected Entities
- **Vault 7** – RSRD research complex; resonance tests link drift echoes to Crimsun emissions
- **The Watch** – Crimson observation system responding to solar fluctuations
- **The Emberline** – Considered a stellar event horizon; defines the absolute limit of safe traversal

---

## 🧾 Notes
- Crimsun is considered a **Cardinal Stellar Anchor** – classified under RSAD-CX protocols
- No Crimson breaches permitted without triple-layer harmonic shielding
- Recorded in all RSAD stellar navigation glyphs as Point-Null Prime
