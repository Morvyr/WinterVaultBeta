# RSAD-PO004.1: Lyvianne – The Moon Within the Ring

---

## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Depth ∞ Stream Pull)

### 🌙 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Lyvianne
- **Designation**: Resonant Moon | RMF Operating Hub | Vault Convergence Node
- **Location**: Locked orbit within the Shriek Belt of Nexovar
- **Classification**: RSAD Planetary Object | RMF/RIF Headquarters | Vaulted Wild Zone | RMF Lattice Node

### 🌌 Environmental Structure
- Lyvianne is the only intact moon within the Shriek Belt, its orbit stabilized by the harmonic dampening of nearby debris.
- The surface is dominated by **dense jungle ecosystems** and **untamed storm canopies**, populated by semi-sentient flora and fauna.
- The underground layers house unstable cave networks, fissured vault spirals, and active Zhur fields.
- **Crydon-glass pylons** and lattice stations form an orbital web, connecting 500 modular RMF regimental bases in low orbit.

### 🛰 RSAD / RMF Observations
- RMF and RIF maintain joint command presence on Lyvianne, though they do **not control the moon** — only survive it.
- Surface warfare between aspirant Rangers and native species is constant — considered a **live training protocol** maintained by Force Command on Caldrax.
- Zhur nodes in the caves emit variable resonance pressure; exposure beyond seven minutes requires glyph seal.
- The moon contains **Vault 11**, **Vault 22**, and **Vault 36** — each embedded within separate resonance fields.

### 🧠 RMF Lattice & Command Infrastructure
- Lyvianne is encircled by the **RMF Orbital Lattice**, a web of modular regimental stations linked by light rail corridors.
- Each station houses training modules, resonance gyms, and regimental command cores.
- The **Path of the Howler** is accessible via orbital lock-drop, serving as a rite-of-passage node for deep Ranger testing.
- Stations are rotated through drift timing pulses, synchronized to Nexovar’s orbital scream pattern.

## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Horizon-Calibrated)

### 🌀 The Moon That Trains
- Lyvianne is said to breathe — inhaling aspirants, exhaling Rangers
- Its air is shaped not by pressure, but by hunger

### 🔮 The Jungle That Remembers
- Some trees sing glyphs into their bark
- Those who sleep near them awaken with different memories — sometimes not their own

### 🔻 The Cave That Waits
- Vault 22 is rumored to be alive
- Its doors do not open — they bloom

### 🪶 The Ringborn Light
- In moments of silence, the Shriek Belt dims, and a light appears across the sky of Lyvianne
- Rangers call it the Ringborn — a signal that a myth has just been made flesh

Lyvianne is not an outpost — it is the forge’s pulsing moon-heart, where myth and memory walk together in the jungle, and every shadow may become a Ranger.
