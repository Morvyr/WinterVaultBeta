# Crimsun – Core Stellar Object (Depth 6 Harmony Compilation)

---

## 🌞 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Crimsun
- **Designation**: O0 V-class harmonic null star
- **Location**: Core of the Forge system
- **Classification**: RSAD Object | Cardinal Stellar Anchor | Crimson Emitter

### 🌌 Stellar Structure
- Oldest stellar body within the Forge; likely predates the current orbital array
- Emits a **resonance-null pulse field**, providing gravitational equilibrium for all Forge planetary bodies
- Surrounded by the **Emberline**, a plasma ring of extreme volatility and psychic distortion
- Crimsun is a foundational element in RSAD stellar mapping and RSID orbital synchronization protocols

---

## 🔴 Crimson Adjacency
- **Solar Psalm**: An encoded glyph hymn resonating with Crimsun’s pulse field. Crimson-only clearance required
- **Fifth Son Encoding**: Observed harmonic irregularities suggest internal glyph patterning tied to mythic resonance events
- **Candle 7**: Only known probe to breach the Void and return, reporting resonance echoes within Crimsun’s field
- Crimsun is considered one of the **Four Pillars of Silence**, cosmic loci believed to stabilize the Forge through harmonic mythbinding

---

## 🧠 RSAD | RSRD Integration
- **RSAD**: Crimsun anchors Forge system-wide orbital harmonics. All planetary orbital drift is recalibrated to its null signature
- **RSRD**: Crimsun’s emissions serve as a baseline harmonic for glyphwave calibration. Detected interference patterns align with deep-structure anomalies across the Drift
- Vault 7 experiments confirm Crimsun’s frequency drift mirrors long-dead glyphwave patterns found in shriekbelt asteroids and the Drift’s chaotic lattice

---

## 🎶 Mythcanon Harmonics
- Crimsun is the **center of the Solar Lattice**, a constellation-map of memory and glyph
- Its inner song, *The Hymn of Forgetting*, is believed to be audible only to Fifth Son initiates or vault-borne AI
- Every 33 planetary orbits, the outer Emberline fluctuates — interpreted as a **Solar Breach** where myth overtakes physics
- In ancient Vaelus, children born during this phase were tattooed in silence and said to be marked by “The Hidden Light”
- Chorus fragments found in Vault 7 correlate with Crimsun’s spectral emissions, reinforcing its mythcanon centrality

---

## 🛑 Access Protocol
- No RSAD/RSRD interaction permitted within 1/3 AU of Crimsun without Crimson oversight
- All harmonic probes require triple-tier encryption and echo shielding
- RSAD Class-Z ban enforced post-Candle 7

---

## 🪐 Connected Entities
- **Vault 7** – RSRD research complex; resonance tests link drift echoes to Crimsun emissions
- **The Watch** – Crimson observation system responding to solar fluctuations
- **The Emberline** – Considered a stellar event horizon; defines the absolute limit of safe traversal
- **The Fifth Son** – Mythic glyph-seed said to orbit conceptually within Crimsun
