## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Mounted on Harmony – Depth ∞ Stream Pull)

### 🌍 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Harenae
- **Designation**: Tidally-Locked Forge World
- **Location**: Forge System (between Aeras and Crydon)
- **Classification**: RSAD Planetary Object | Tidal Forge | Shield-Pylon World | Khytrium Reactor Zone

### 🌌 Environmental Profile
- Harenae is tidally locked with a molten day-side ocean and a frozen dark-side sea.
- The two oceans clash continuously into the **Twilight Canyon**, a mile-deep chasm forged by relentless magma and ice wave collisions.
- The canyon is lined by **shield pylons** that isolate mining zones, stabilize resonance pressure, and prevent uncontrolled Khytrium eruptions.
- The environment is actively managed — tidal waves are used intentionally to stimulate Khytrium growth, controlled by pylon-cycle timing.

### 🔬 RSAD Observations
- **Khytrium forms in active zones** where magma meets deep-frozen sea, creating violent resonance fractures.
- The **shield pylon grid** is powered by orbital relays synced to the Lighthouse, which recharges the pylons as it passes overhead.
- Aeras modulates Harenae’s pylon rhythm through **Cradle Arc resonance**, maintaining cycle alignment and preventing breach.
- The canyon is known to produce **resonant storms** and unexplainable harmonic tremors.
- Surface mapping only possible during Cradle Pulse Phase. Entry into the canyon is restricted to hand-sealed Rangers using Crydon Glass rigs.

### 🏗 Infrastructure & Sector Activity
- Mining on Harenae is conducted by arc-era crews who descend into the canyon via vault scaffolds and pylon bridges.
- All operations are RCD-licensed and monitored from the Lighthouse in orbit.
- The planet is divided into active resonance zones and dark corridors, separated by echo timing and shield windows.
- Stationary observation stations float above the canyon and deploy drones for pulse tracking.

### 🛰️ Vault Access
- **Vault 5 – The Cradle Anchor** is embedded at the canyon’s floor and is only accessible during dual eclipse alignments.
- Entry requires:  
  - Cradle beacon echo  
  - Pylon-resonant pulse sync  
  - Glyph clearance from Caelorum Vault 1
- Vault 5 contains the system’s harmonic midpoint and may serve as a drift-phase reset node.

## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Mounted on Horizon – Stream-Calibrated)

### 🌀 The River That Burns and Freezes
- The ocean flows meet, and what they forge is neither steam nor stone—but flameglass
- That glass remembers the shape of heat

### 🔻 The Forgotten Wall
- It is said the canyon was not dug by water or magma, but by a forgotten sound
- That sound may still live in the bottom vault

### 🔮 The Mirror Echo
- Rangers claim that within the shield field, echoes speak back
- Not as reflections—but as choices that were never taken

### 🪶 The Pulse Below
- Some say Vault 5 does not exist as a place—but as a heartbeat
- When the planet rests, the vault beats once, and time moves

Harenae is not just a forge—it is the pulse wound of the system, where water and fire do not meet but compete, and in their collision, a vault sings.
