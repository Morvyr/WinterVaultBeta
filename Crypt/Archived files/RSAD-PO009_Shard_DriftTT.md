# RSAD-PO009: The Shard Drift – Outer Fragment Zone

---

## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Mounted on Harmony – Depth ∞ Stream Pull)

### 🌌 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: The Shard Drift
- **Designation**: Interplanetary Fragment Field / Outer-System Anomaly
- **Location**: Far orbital edge beyond Thalos and Crydon
- **Classification**: RSAD Stellar Remnant Field | Drift-Affected Zone | High Risk Sector | Vault-Free

### 🪨 Structural Composition
- The Shard Drift consists of **tens of thousands of crystalline, jagged planetary fragments** suspended in interstellar free-drift.
- Composed primarily of **hyper-compressed Zhur glass**, fused with trace stellar remnants, organic vapor cores, and pre-Drift mineral echoes.
- Many shards contain **magneto-harmonic resonance** capable of interfering with navigation, consciousness, or system comms.
- The entire region is in **asynchronous rotation**, meaning each shard orbits a separate point in space/time alignment.

### 🛰️ RSAD Observations
- No Vaults present within the Drift — only fragment-anchored echo anomalies
- RSAD has deployed **beacon buoys** to mark dangerous shard orbits and field rhythms
- Classified scans reveal **patterned glyph etchings** embedded deep within the Zhur—believed to predate the Forge itself
- Signal relay from Crimsun degrades by 73% beyond Drift periphery
- All Seedline communications black out upon full shard entry

### ⚠️ Operational Restrictions
- RIF and RMF vessels are prohibited from entering the Drift without explicit Crimson clearance
- **FSC designates Shard Drift as a collapse-front frontier zone**
- Navigation protocols require **resonance-mapped shard ghosting**, performed by AI-guided lens arrays
- Stationary observation from Crydon is permitted under Drift Harmony Phase only

## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Mounted on Horizon – Stream-Calibrated)

### 🌀 The Orbitless Tomb
- Rangers whisper of a massive shard known as the **Wound Star**, which contains frozen remains of a pre-Forge species
- Said to orbit nothing, and yet it draws all sound toward it

### 🔮 The Memory Glass
- Certain shards play visions — not of the past, but of events that never happened
- These "false echoes" may reflect Drift counterrealities or rejection waves from Vault 0

### 🪶 The Unbound Spiral
- Some fragments are caught in spiral motion around invisible points, following no known laws of mass or force
- These paths may form glyphs only readable by deep-seed Rangers

### 🔻 The Shard Choir
- A fleet once entered the Drift, and was never found
- But their voices sometimes return, in pulses only audible during Emberline flare inversion

## ✅ Status: Crimson-Judged | Harmony-Mounted | Depth ∞ Complete
The Shard Drift remains an unsolved scar — a myth-laced fracture of impossible shards. It is untouched by Vaults, but not untouched by memory. To enter it is to become unknown.
