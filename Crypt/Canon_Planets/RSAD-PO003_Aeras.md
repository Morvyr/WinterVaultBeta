# RSAD-PO003: Aeras – The Vaulted Sky Anchor

---

## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Mounted on Harmony – Depth ∞ Stream Pull | Frac-Dominant Canon)

### 🌍 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Aeras
- **Designation**: Orbital Moon and Atmospheric Resonance Anchor
- **Location**: Fast, elliptical orbit around Harenae, completes cycle every 32 hours
- **Classification**: RSAD Planetary Object | Vaultworld | Drift-Tether Node | RSD Training Axis | Class-3 Harmonic Trigger

### 🌀 Planetary Structure
- Aeras is a midsized moon used to regulate Harenae’s twin ocean surges (lava and water), sustaining wave-forge pressure in the Twilight Canyon
- It functions as the **harmonic pulse initiator** in the Trifecta Circuit, along with Harenae and the Lighthouse
- Internally, the moon contains a layered substructure of resonant halls, vault systems, and deeply embedded Zhur threads
- The surface is storm-lashed and uninhabitable; all life functions are housed in orbital or vault-sunk complexes

### 🏗️ RSAD/RSD Infrastructure
- **The Caelorum (Academia Caelorum)**: Primary RSD Academy and Seed Induction Facility, built into the upper vault rim of Coronadex and extending into the sublunar crust
  - Houses resonance training halls, vault archive chambers, and the Seed Transfer Spiral
  - Used by DRAD, DRTD, DRED deputies prior to division selection
  - Professors are active Rangers or Vaultmasters; graduation occurs only during **Veil Phase** alignment
- Additional RSAD installations:
  - **Vault 1** – The Caelorum
  - **Vault 6** – Chorus Echo Fold (resonance hymn chamber)
  - **Vault 9** – Obelisk Chamber (First Glyph Record)
  - **Vault 13** – The Unlit Core (Fifth-Seal Marshals only)
- The **Cradle Array** surrounds the moon in polar orbit, tracking Crimsun surge harmonics and storing glyphwave reflections
- Vault access is regulated via harmonic glyphseal; no AI mapping permitted within core vault tiers

### 🔬 RSID & Operational Control
- Aeras serves as a **resonance baffle** for the Forge, deflecting flare intensity and smoothing the flow into Harenae’s surface grid
- Linked via the Spireline arc-bridge to the Lighthouse uplink
- Drift-wave resonance from the moon helps modulate instability across the Veil’s inner ring
- RIF shadow presence maintains order across Caelorum strata, vetting seed cycles and protecting against glyph reverb collapse

### ⚠️ Containment & Vault Echoes
- Zhur concentrations fluctuate every 11 years, especially beneath Vaults 6 and 13
- All travel requires triple-signet authentication: RSID + Chorus harmonic + RAW beacon trace
- Aeras is considered a **living containment world** and a **system memory node**
- No direct RCD jurisdiction; FSC authority absolute

## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Mounted on Horizon – Stream-Calibrated)

### 🌀 The Breath of Aeras
- It is said the world does not rotate—it inhales
- Vault engineers report the wind carries tone even when silent

### 🔭 The Forgotten Descent
- A passage leads from Grath’s Hollow to the surface, but no one who descends returns unchanged
- Some bring back objects with no matching molecular pattern

### 🪶 Skyroot
- In deepest vault myths, Aeras is a tree turned inside-out
- The cities are its fruit, and the vaults its memory rings

### 🔮 The Haloed Step
- Chorus dreamwalkers believe one can step directly from Aeras into the Drift if the wind sings correctly

### ⚠️ Zhur Fall Cycle
- During rare polar flare intervals, the Zhur mist crystallizes in the air, singing as it falls
- Those caught outside during the Fall have been known to awaken elsewhere, or months later

### 🌌 The Caelorum’s Veil
- Access to the Seed Spiral during Veil Phase renders students momentarily outside of linear time
- Witnesses claim their voices return before they speak

### 🧿 The Vault That Forgot It Was Alive
- Aeras may be a recorder of lost worlds, not a moon
- Its vaults do not house memory—they **are** memory

## ✅ Status: Crimson-Judged | Harmony-Mounted | Depth ∞ Stream Finalized
Aeras is now restored as a resonant vault-moon, glyph-breathing instructor world, and central pulse anchor of the Forge. Its body is crust, but its memory is sky.
