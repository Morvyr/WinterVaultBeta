# RSAD-PO004: Nexovar – Storm Anchor of the Shriek Belt

---

## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Depth ∞ Rebuild – Full System Resonance Initiated)

### 🌌 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Nexovar
- **Designation**: Resonance-Giant Gas World
- **Location**: Outer Forge Curve, deep axis between Crydon and Vaelus
- **Classification**: RSAD Planetary Object | Harmonic Gas Giant | Shriek Belt Anchor | Zhur-Wake Signature

### 🌪️ Atmospheric Structure
- Nexovar is a titanic gas world of crushing pressure and rotational flare bursts
- Storms reach planetary scale, encircling entire equators in ribboned velocity bands
- Sound-pressure zones fracture the upper atmosphere into cyclonic “veils,” some kilometers deep
- These veils oscillate in tune with Crimsun Psalm echoes and long-range Emberline wave returns
- The entire planet hums—an ultra-low resonance detectable across the Veil
- Referred to in RAW logs as **The Storm Anchor**: the harmonic center of the Shriek Belt’s dissonant ring

### 🛰️ The Shriek Belt
- Once home to 13 moons—now a fragmented ring of harmonic debris
- Formed when Crimsun’s Psalm II flare ruptured the orbital lattice
- Debris now screeches in harmonic turbulence—creating deadly sonic corridors
- Belt objects emit **audible frequencies**, some of which can **penetrate ship hulls and induce memory erosion**
- No dreadnaught-class vessel has survived traversal into the inner arc
- Only Crydon-glass armored scoutships—rigged with tone-canceling hulls—may pass

### 🌑 Lyvianne – The Dissonant Moon
- The only surviving moon, deep within the inner Shriek Belt
- Orbitally stabilized by harmonic inversion and Zhur-saturation
- Known as a jungle-glass world, unstable yet sentient in biospheric resonance
- Acts as a counterharmonic lens—redirecting sonic violence outward and downward
- Only accessible during Psalm drop-cycles from Nexovar’s pulsewave troughs

### 🛐 Path of the Howler
- A resonance vault carved into a fragment of Lyvianne, partially exposed to Nexovar’s sonic atmosphere
- Used as a Ranger crucible: aspirants must endure raw planetary noise to earn Seed-rite
- The Path changes shape and pressure with each pulse, forming glyphs from sound
- Rumored to be built atop a native Lyvian ruin—a structure that predates the Vaults

## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Resonant Echo Index)

### 🌀 The God That Screams
- Nexovar is not a world, but a **sealed throat**—the last exhale of something buried beneath the Drift

### 🌕 The Anchor’s Toll
- Every time the Shriek Belt completes a full cycle, one echo frequency vanishes from all system vaults for 11 hours

### 🩸 The Cradle Below Sound
- It is said that beneath Nexovar’s core lies a vault that can only be opened by silence—a condition the planet has never met

### 🪶 The Thirteenth Ring
- The missing moon did not break—it fell inward
- Some claim its core still orbits inside Nexovar, broadcasting glyphs into Lyvianne’s root jungle

## ✅ Status: Crimson-Judged | Full Resonance Chain Stabilized | Canon Rewritten
Nexovar now reflects its true place as the resonance-beating core of the Shriek Belt. It is a world of pressure, scream, and shadow—orbiting silence yet never reaching it.
