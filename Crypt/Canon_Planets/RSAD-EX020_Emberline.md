# RSAD-EX020: Emberline – Harmonic Flare Halo

---

## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Harmony Reopened – Aeras, Lighthouse, and Crimsun Integrated)

### 🌌 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Emberline
- **Designation**: Circumstellar Harmonic Field
- **Location**: Radiant flare band encircling Crimsun, synchronized with planetary drift patterns
- **Classification**: RSAD Stellar Phenomenon | Flare Halo | System Breath Vector | Resonance Amplifier

### 🌀 Structural Behavior
- The Emberline is a **rotating pulse sheath**—a halo of harmonic energy and flarewave emissions surrounding Crimsun
- Composed of plasma-bound Zhur particles entrained by drift harmonics and solar pulse shockwaves
- Expands and contracts cyclically every 27.1 days, affecting:
  - Harenae tidal surges
  - Thalos resonance fracture flickers
  - Aeras pulsefield stabilization
  - Drift Gate navigation windows

### 🔬 RSAD Observations
- Recorded flares align with **Crimsun Psalm emission sequences**
- Psalm IV waveform was reflected off Thalos and captured in Lighthouse’s Echo Halo
- During Zhur spike events, **Emberline intensifies Harenae’s Khytrium growth** by destabilizing surface pulse retention
- Aeras' Cradle Array modulates Emberline pressure into harmonic waves—smoothing their impact across the Veil

### 🧠 RSID & Lighthouse Coordination
- The Lighthouse uses synchronized uplinks to detect and buffer incoming flare distortion
- Aeras coordinates glyphwave redistribution through Vault 6 echo folds, dissipating solar surge buildup
- During Veil Phase alignment, flare harmonics become **echo-predictive** and traceable through Zhur mist patterns

### ⚠️ Resonance Effect Zones
- Emberline pulses drive:
  - Zhur bloom shadows across Harenae’s canyon floor
  - Glyph flicker patterns inside Vault 13 on Aeras
  - Drift distortion arcs requiring recalibration of system-wide navigational lattices

## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Remounted on Horizon)

### 🔻 The Breath Between Suns
- It is not fire, but memory returned as light
- Old myths say the Emberline is the shadow Crimsun cast before being born

### 🌀 The Shimmer Scar
- The flare that sings is said to leave scars across vault walls—glyphs no one remembers writing

### 🪶 The Invisible Rain
- Rangers stationed on Harenae describe a windless rain that sings and burns before vanishing

### 🔮 The Halo’s Chime
- Only during full alignment with Aeras and Crimsun do vaults emit harmonic chimes in echo of the flare—once every six years

## 🌀 Classification Tags
- `CANON` | `META` | `RSAD` | `RSID` | `STELLAR-FIELD` | `ZHURO-PLASMA` | `FLARE-ECHO` | `CRIMSON-ZONE` | `CAELORUM-LINKED`

## ✅ Status: Crimson-Judged | Harmony Reopened | Multi-Anchor Integrated
Emberline now reflects its position as the luminous breath of the system—a surge between memory and heat, echo and vault, flare and seed.
