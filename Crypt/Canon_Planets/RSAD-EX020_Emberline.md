# RSAD-EX020: Emberline – Stellar Event Horizon

---

## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record

### 🔥 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Emberline
- **Designation**: Circumstellar plasma ring of Crimsun
- **Location**: Encircles Crimsun at harmonic flare boundary
- **Classification**: RSAD Stellar Phenomenon | Drift Barrier | Temporal Distortion Zone

### 🌌 Structural Properties
- The Emberline is a **plasma ring** composed of Crimsun’s inverted waveform emissions
- Exists at the outer limit of Crimsun’s resonance-null field
- Composed of charged photonic matter, magnetic arcs, harmonic radiation, and subharmonic wavefronts
- Functions as a **resonance boundary** and **containment sheath** for Crimsun’s null pulse
- Appears visually as a superheated auroral band, constantly shifting color and intensity
- Distorts light and waveform data; sensor readings become inverted, delayed, or erased

### 🔬 RSAD Integration
- Designated RSAD-CX: **Stellar Event Horizon**
- Interferes with standard probe resonance and disorients orbital satellites
- Considered a **harmonic event horizon** — Crimsun’s waveform memory ceases to reflect beyond it
- Encounters result in disintegration of matter, signal silence, and **memory bleed**
- Zhur samples exposed to Emberline pulses destabilize or bloom unpredictably

### 📡 RSRD Notes
- Surrounding the Emberline are dynamic electromagnetic shearwalls and flux boundaries
- Acts as a **harmonic mirror**, reflecting resonance patterns into the Drift
- All beacon signals collapse at the ring’s inner edge — creating a **null shell**
- Vault 7 and Archive protocols log **Solar Breach Cycles** every 33 planetary orbits
- Emberline emissions match turbulence signatures near Vaelus and Nexovar

### 🧠 RSID / Vault Observations
- RSID mapping incomplete; no probes have returned from within 1 AU
- Thought to be a **natural glyph recursion zone** — resonance echoes loop within
- Dust filaments display behavior akin to **motion memory** — reforming into old patterns over decades
- Crimson observers theorize the Emberline may anchor a **subharmonic erasure field** at the edge of the Void

### 🛑 Field Protocol
- No vessel larger than Star-Class interceptor may pass without echo-stabilization
- Glyph dampeners required to prevent scarflame resonance ignition
- All entries logged under Crimson Code EM-BR33

## 🔮 Disparate Myth Fragments (Mounted on Myth – Harmony Calibrated)

### 🕯️ The Wreath of the Fallen
- Said to encircle Crimsun as the last song of an ancient war between sky-shapers
- Rangers once tossed the ashes of the dead into the Emberline so they would “burn into memory”
- Ash spirals are said to create fractal glyphs readable only by blind monks in solar trance

### 🧿 The Emberline Speaks
- Crimson myth states that the Emberline can **transmit memory pulses** back into dreaming minds
- Rangers report waking with symbols they have no language for, etched in flame behind their eyelids

### 🌀 Scar Chimes
- Old drift sailors claim they hear **bell tones** in their skulls while skimming close to the ring
- These tones match harmonic fragments found in pre-Drift psalmstone architecture, suggesting deep temporal loopbacks

### 🗡️ The Scarward Flame
- Some Rangers undergo ritual incandescence when passing the Emberline with dual resonance scars
- They ignite without fire, burning only with *what they remember too clearly* — a rite known as “the inward blaze”

### 🛸 The Ember Choir
- Vault 9 fragments describe a **singing field** beyond the ring where voices loop eternally
- Theories suggest this may be a memory recursion zone — where dying thoughts refuse to fall silent

### 🌌 Great Pulse Gate
- RAW pilots call the Emberline the **Great Pulse Gate** — the final harmonic barrier before all coordinates fail
- During flare drift, it is said to breathe, its pulse dragging ships through forgotten songs

### 👁️ The Watching Eye
- Described in forbidden glyphworks as “**the eye that watches the star from within**”
- Believed by scarred Rangers to be Crimsun itself—dreaming through the ring, seeing only what resists forgetting
