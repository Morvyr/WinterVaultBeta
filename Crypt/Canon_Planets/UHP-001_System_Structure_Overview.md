## ðŸ”· NAVIGATIONAL LAYOUT (Forge & Beyond)

<!-- UHP-ID:CRIMSUN -->
1. **Crimsun**  
> The central stellar engine. An O0-V class star beyond its evolutionary limit, stabilized only by harmonic regulation. Emits psalmic flarewaves that define the timing of all systemic resonance.

<!-- UHP-ID:EMBERLINE -->
2. **Emberline**  
> A plasma-bound halo sheath orbiting Crimsun. Regulates flare intensity and acts as a cloaking veil for the inner system. Refracts harmonic pressure into stable orbital bands.

<!-- UHP-ID:THALOS -->
3. **Thalos**  
> A rogue planetary shard locked in chaotic orbit. Thought to be a former moon of Rook, cast into the system by ancient war. Phase-locked to Psalm IV and Emberline contraction.

<!-- UHP-ID:SHARD-DRIFT -->
4. **The Shard Drift**  
> A labyrinthine debris field between Thalos and Crydon. Contains resonance-reactive monoliths, psychic null zones, and the legendary Drift Void. RAW-class hazard zone.

<!-- UHP-ID:CRYDON -->
5. **Crydon**  
> An ice-resonance planet between the Drift and Harenae. Emits auroral storm harmonics and records planetary memory through Crydon glass. Unmanned, AI-regulated.

<!-- UHP-ID:HARENAE -->
6. **Harenae**  
> The pulse crucible of the Forgeâ€”where lava, water, and resonance converge in the Twilight Canyon. Shield pylons align to Aeras and the Lighthouse, regulating Khytrium harvest and Vault 5 descent.

<!-- UHP-ID:LIGHTHOUSE -->
7. **The Lighthouse**  
> Orbital vault and pulse relay above Harenae. Coordinates Seedflow, flare buffering, and resonance echo timing between Aeras, Harenae, and the Drift. Home of the Orator.

<!-- UHP-ID:AERAS -->
8. **Aeras**  
> Vault moon of the Caelorum and the Cradle Array. Anchor of Seedflow timing and origin point of the Ranger Science Divisionâ€™s Seed Paths. Houses Vault 6, the Prime Glyph archive.

<!-- UHP-ID:NEXOVAR -->
9. **Nexovar**  
> The Storm Anchor of the Shriek Belt. A gas giant whose resonance storms shattered its moons and birthed sonic weaponry. Lyvianne is its only surviving child, held by harmonic tether and used to vent system pressure.

<!-- UHP-ID:LYVIANNE -->
10. **Lyvianne**  
> Jungle-glass crucible moon. Ringed in the Lyvianne Lattice, it serves as the origin of all Ranger training. Vault 22 anchors resonance feedback from Nexovar.

<!-- UHP-ID:VAELUS -->
11. **Vaelus** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> The land that fell. Split between fertile undercanopy and ruined overland. Called the Range and the Valley by Rangers who patrol its twin faces.

<!-- UHP-ID:SOLARII -->
12. **Solarii** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> Lightborn jewel of Vaelus. An orbital resort and diplomatic sanctuary â€” if it ever truly existed.

<!-- UHP-ID:CALDRAX -->
13. **Caldrax** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> The vault-military moon. Seat of Force Command. Where silence walks in the shadow of the gun.

<!-- UHP-ID:ARANSAS -->
14. **Aransas** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> The Library of the Sky. Said to hold every Rangerâ€™s past and every map never drawn.

<!-- UHP-ID:SCINT-VEIL -->
15. **Scint Veil** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> A deep photonic curtain wrapped around the system. Half-shadow, half-door. Thought to be the reason the Forge was never found.

<!-- UHP-ID:ROOKS-HALO -->
16. **Rookâ€™s Halo** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> Cracked planetary ruins now lost beyond Drift. Source of Thalos? Gate of the First Collapse?

<!-- UHP-ID:VARNUS -->
17. **Varnus** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> The furnace-world. Once industrial, now consumed. Still echoes.

<!-- UHP-ID:BLACKREACH -->
18. **Blackreach Expanse** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> The silent margin. Territory of exile and exileâ€™s memory.

<!-- UHP-ID:HORIZON -->
19. **Horizon** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> Said to be the edge where memory fails. The line the stars forgot.

## ðŸ§¬ SYSTEM STATUS
- `CANON CONFIRMED`: Crimsun, Emberline, Thalos, Shard Drift, Crydon, Harenae, Aeras, The Lighthouse, Nexovar, Lyvianne
- `PENDING RECONSTRUCTION`: Vaelus and all outer-system bodies
- `MYTH LAYER ACTIVE`: Remaining entries currently exist in resonance or speculative echo only

> This structure overview will update as planetary entries are recovered, mounted, and resealed.
