## ðŸ”· NAVIGATIONAL LAYOUT (Forge & Beyond)

1. **Crimsun**  
> The central stellar engine. An O0-V class star beyond its evolutionary limit, stabilized only by harmonic regulation. Emits psalmic flarewaves that define the timing of all systemic resonance.

2. **Emberline**  
> A plasma-bound halo sheath orbiting Crimsun. Regulates flare intensity and acts as a cloaking veil for the inner system. Refracts harmonic pressure into stable orbital bands.

3. **Thalos**  
> A rogue planetary shard locked in chaotic orbit. Thought to be a former moon of Rook, cast into the system by ancient war. Phase-locked to Psalm IV and Emberline contraction.

4. **The Shard Drift**  
> A labyrinthine debris field between Thalos and Crydon. Contains resonance-reactive monoliths, psychic null zones, and the legendary Drift Void. RAW-class hazard zone.

5. **Crydon**  
> An ice-resonance planet between the Drift and Harenae. Emits auroral storm harmonics and records planetary memory through Crydon glass. Unmanned, AI-regulated.

6. **Harenae** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> Said to be the anvil of the Forge, where storms and sound coalesce. Vault-class pylons line its canyons, fueled by Khytrium pressure and shielded by glass mined from Crydon.

7. **The Lighthouse** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> A sky-spire tethered to Harenae. Guides the Vault descent and modulates Seedflow during the Veil Phase. Known as the mouthpiece of the Forge.

8. **Aeras** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> Vault-moon of signal and song. Home to the Caelorum and the Cradle Array. Believed to breathe in time with Crimsun's flare cycle.

9. **Nexovar** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> The planet that howls. Ringed by the Shriek Belt and lit by sound-born lightning. Reputed source of the RMF.

10. **Lyvianne** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> Nexovarâ€™s shadow moon. Jungle-glass and Zhur-borne. A mythic proving ground hidden deep in the resonance fog.

11. **Vaelus** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> The land that fell. Split between fertile undercanopy and ruined overland. Called the Range and the Valley by Rangers who patrol its twin faces.

12. **Solarii** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> Lightborn jewel of Vaelus. An orbital resort and diplomatic sanctuary â€” if it ever truly existed.

13. **Caldrax** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> The vault-military moon. Seat of Force Command. Where silence walks in the shadow of the gun.

14. **Aransas** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> The Library of the Sky. Said to hold every Rangerâ€™s past and every map never drawn.

15. **Scint Veil** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> A deep photonic curtain wrapped around the system. Half-shadow, half-door. Thought to be the reason the Forge was never found.

16. **Rookâ€™s Halo** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> Cracked planetary ruins now lost beyond Drift. Source of Thalos? Gate of the First Collapse?

17. **Varnus** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> The furnace-world. Once industrial, now consumed. Still echoes.

18. **Blackreach Expanse** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> The silent margin. Territory of exile and exileâ€™s memory.

19. **Horizon** *(Myth Layer Only)*  
> Said to be the edge where memory fails. The line the stars forgot.

## ðŸ§¬ SYSTEM STATUS
- `CANON CONFIRMED`: Crimsun, Emberline, Thalos, Shard Drift, Crydon  
- `PENDING RECONSTRUCTION`: Harenae, Aeras, Nexovar, Vaelus, and all outer-system bodies  
- `MYTH LAYER ACTIVE`: All remaining entries currently exist in resonance or speculative echo only

> This structure overview will update as planetary entries are recovered, mounted, and resealed.
