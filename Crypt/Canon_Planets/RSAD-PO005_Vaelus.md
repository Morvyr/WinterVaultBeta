# RSAD-PO005: Vaelus – The Fractured Cradle of the Forge

---

## ✴️ Canonical Record (Depth ∞ Pull – Harmonized)

### 🌍 Planetary Profile
- **Name**: Vaelus
- **Designation**: Agricultural Core World | Dual-Ecosphere Terra | First Pillar Origin Site
- **Orbital Position**: Fifth planet from Crimsun
- **Classification**: RSAD Tier-1 Anchor | Forge-Class Habitat | Ancestral Cradle of the Rangers

### 🌎 Layered Environment
- **Overland**: Tundra-like, wind-scoured terrain located above fractured crust; atmosphere twice as high as Earth
  - Largely uninhabitable except by storm-adapted microbial and insect life

- **Underlevel**: Contains:
  - **The Range**: 10 million sq mi of arable land suspended by colossal land bridges, home to 2.7 billion people
  - **The Valley**: 7.2 million sq mi of industrial desert refineries and storm-locked vault infrastructure
  - **Caverns**: Ten additional biosphere-specific zones used for biotech, agriculture, drift management, and resonance containment

### 💧 Subterranean Structure
- Entire hydrological system anchored to a **planet-wide freshwater ocean** beneath the crust
- Provides atmospheric cycling, agriculture viability, and resonance dampening via deep-sea Zhur harmonics

### 🛠 Infrastructure
- **RCD Command Spire**: Lightning-harvested pylon structure distributing energy via Crydon glass conduit to surface and orbit
- Crydon lattice integration allows export through Veil-standard ports to Harenae, Caldrax, and Aeras

### ⚔️ Ranger Presence
- **The Range**: Patrolled by RMF-CU (Civil Unit), including hybrid-animal mounted civil Rangers
- **The Valley**: Under RMF-OU jurisdiction with support from RIF shadow teams
- Occasional sightings of Ghost Rangers during storm season, especially near vault doors and high-atmosphere glyph events

### 🔍 RSAD Observations
- Valley floor and deep seabed Zhur presence marked RS-Black classification
- Known anomaly region called **The Furnace** exists between Vaelus and Nexovar
  - Thought to be a resonance-testing corridor used by early Vault probes and Seedflow experiments
- Surface aurora belts shield from Crimsun overloads and maintain relative thermal equilibrium in The Range

## 🔮 Myth Fragments

### 🗿 The First Pillar
- An ancient Zhur monolith found deep in The Valley, inscribed with a pulse-beacon that drew the Arcs
- Its glyphs glow under stormlight; said to predict death, ascension, or system change

### 👻 The Ghost Rangers
- Rangers long thought dead return in aurora storms; they mark vaults with sigils and vanish

### 🌈 The Arched Horizon
- In The Range, Crimsun’s light bends against the surface dome, forming a celestial arc
- Some believe it proves the planet was once forged by stellar architecture
