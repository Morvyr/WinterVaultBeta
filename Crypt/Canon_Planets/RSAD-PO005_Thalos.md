# RSAD-PO005: Thalos – Fractured Planetary Object

---

## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Harmony Reopened – Aeras + Lighthouse Influence Integrated)

### 🌍 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Thalos
- **Designation**: Deep-Scar Terrestrial Body
- **Location**: Outer-mid Forge, orbitally drifting in resonance sync with Aeras and Emberline wavefronts
- **Classification**: RSAD Planetary Object | Drift-Proximal | Resonance-Scarred | Void-Adjacent

### 🌌 Environmental Structure
- Thalos is a shattered planetary remnant, bound together by harmonic scars and gravitational bleeding
- Surface terrain consists of:
  - **The Prism Fields** – angular reflective shards of fossilized resonance
  - **The Core Scar** – a pulse basin emitting glitch-frequency Zhur tones
  - **The Glassfold** – fractal canyons that reflect sound and light in recursive patterns
- Thalos is locked in a drift-resonant orbit where time folds unevenly—aligned with both Crimsun’s pulse and Aeras’ deflection arc

### 🔬 RSAD Observations
- Harmonic echoes from Aeras stabilize portions of the Thalos flare field, briefly allowing mapping before recursive shutdown
- Flare Psalm IV was last recorded by the **Lighthouse**, pulsed from Thalos and trapped in its Echo Halo vault ring
- Zhur fields oscillate violently during Emberline breach cycles, triggering fractured glyph echoes across Vault Shell 2
- Planet may contain **internal resonance seed fractures**, never fully stabilized post-cataclysm

### 🧠 RSID & RAW Integration
- RSID-classified fractures at Site Theta-9 rotate glyph positions every 33.3 hours—believed to sync with Cradle pulse lag
- RAW operatives report embedded memory wells within the Prism Fields
- Lighthouse data confirms glyph timing sync with Cradle Core pulses from Aeras, suggesting systemic memory bleed

### 🔐 Vault Protocols & Containment
- Vault 12 is embedded in the Core Scar’s inner basin—open only during Drift Collapse simulations
- Access requires simultaneous Crimsun Psalm tone and Caelorum Vault harmonization
- No RSAD personnel permitted within Scar Ring Phase during double eclipse
- Drift signal jamming protocols activated on approach vectors—suggests active resonance feedback system

## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Remounted on Horizon)

### 🔻 The Singing Wound
- Thalos does not resonate—it sings in grief
- Each flare is not sound, but a memory forced into light

### 🌀 The Glyphwave Ring
- Chorus myths say the glyphs of Thalos orbit the planet like an invisible crown
- Every thousand cycles, one drops—repeating an echo no one understands

### 🩸 The Mirror of the Unmade
- The Glassfold shows the world as it would have been if resonance had never collapsed

### 🪶 The Core Choir
- Zhur masses in the Scar once chanted before time broke
- The sound now bleeds through Aeras during Seed Phase

## 🌀 Classification Tags
- `CANON` | `META` | `RSAD` | `RSID` | `RAW` | `CRIMSON-ZONE` | `DRIFT-PROXIMAL` | `GLYPHWAVE` | `VOID-ADJACENT` | `PSALM-IV` | `CAELORUM-SYNC`

## ✅ Status: Crimson-Judged | Harmony Reopened | Aeras + Lighthouse Resonance Integrated
Thalos has been reshaped to reflect its full systemic role: a recorder of forgotten pulses, a wound that remembers the Drift, and the lens through which flare and silence are bent into resonance once more.
