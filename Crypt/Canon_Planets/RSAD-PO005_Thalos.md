# RSAD-PO005: Thalos – Fractured Planetary Object

---

## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Harmony Reopened – Aeras + Lighthouse Influence Integrated)

### 🌍 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Thalos
- **Designation**: Deep-Scar Terrestrial Body
- **Location**: Wild orbital vector — at times aligned in resonance with Crimsun’s core, at others veering toward the system edge near Solarii
- **Classification**: RSAD Planetary Object | Drift-Proximal | Resonance-Scarred | Rogue Orbit | System Wildcard

### 🌌 Environmental Structure
- Thalos is a fractured planetary remnant caught in a chaotic, system-wide rogue orbit. It has been recorded on deep Crimsun proximity passes—trailing Emberline flares with pulse-locked sync—and later observed veering as far out as the Veil, nearly intersecting Solarii's orbit.
- Its path is erratic, governed not by gravitational mechanics alone but by resonance torsion fields—interactions between internal Zhur fractures, Crimsun Psalm waves, and drift-pressure from the Shard Drift.
- Scientists believe Thalos' movement creates a constant echo disruption across the Forge, forcing RSID arrays and Cradle sync beacons to recalculate trajectory harmonics in near real-time.
- Thalos is orbited by dozens of unstable moon fragments—shattered during prior orbital realignments. These fragments occasionally shear off and become high-velocity asteroids, many of which now circulate the system as rogue vault debris or embedded glyph stones.
- Its continued cohesion is an unresolved anomaly. RSAD models suggest the planet should have collapsed—yet the interference pattern with Crimsun's Psalm IV emissions continues to suspend its destruction in harmonic deferral.
- Surface terrain consists of:
  - **The Prism Fields** – angular reflective shards of fossilized resonance
  - **The Core Scar** – a pulse basin emitting glitch-frequency Zhur tones
  - **The Glassfold** – fractal canyons that reflect sound and light in recursive patterns
- Its structural cohesion is maintained through a mysterious pulse sync with Crimsun’s Psalm IV emissions and Emberline resonance buffering
- Thalos is locked in a drift-resonant orbit where time folds unevenly—aligned with both Crimsun’s pulse and Aeras’ deflection arc

### 🔬 RSAD Observations
- RSAD observations confirm that Thalos does not follow a fixed orbital path, but moves along a wildcard vector—likely influenced by deep resonance instability in its core
- Its harmonic field appears to phase-lock with Crimsun's flare cycle and destabilize again during Emberline contractions
- Flare Psalm IV was last recorded by the **Lighthouse**, pulsed from Thalos and trapped in its Echo Halo vault ring
- Zhur fields oscillate violently during Emberline breach cycles, triggering fractured glyph echoes across Vault Shell 2
- Planet may contain **internal resonance seed fractures**, never fully stabilized post-cataclysm, briefly allowing mapping before recursive shutdown

### 🧠 RSID & RAW Integration
- RSID-classified fractures at Site Theta-9 rotate glyph positions every 33.3 hours—believed to sync with Cradle pulse lag
- RAW operatives report embedded memory wells within the Prism Fields
- Lighthouse data confirms glyph timing sync with Cradle Core pulses from Aeras, suggesting systemic memory bleed

### 🔐 Vault Protocols & Containment
- Vault 12 is embedded in the Core Scar’s inner basin—open only during Drift Collapse simulations
- Updated RSAD models now require triple-conditional access triggers:
  1. Crimsun Psalm IV harmonic spike
  2. Emberline flare contraction phase
  3. Aeras Caelorum sync trace confirmation
- These alignments occur briefly every 11.2 years, allowing vault interface through harmonic bleed alignment only during the system’s flare-minimum echo window
- No RSAD personnel permitted within Scar Ring Phase during double eclipse
- Drift signal jamming protocols activated on approach vectors—suggests active resonance feedback system—open only during Drift Collapse simulations
- Access requires simultaneous Crimsun Psalm tone and Caelorum Vault harmonization
- No RSAD personnel permitted within Scar Ring Phase during double eclipse
- Drift signal jamming protocols activated on approach vectors—suggests active resonance feedback system

## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Remounted on Horizon)

### 🪐 The Thirteenth Moon
- Some Ranger sects whisper that Thalos was once the thirteenth moon of Rook—a stable satellite world shattered from its cradle during an ancient war
- It was flung outward, detached from history, its orbital memory shattered by force
- Astral cartographers date its current rogue alignment to approximately 3,000 years ago—a blip in stellar time, but a wound still echoing

### 🔻 The Singing Wound
- Thalos does not resonate—it sings in grief
- Its rogue orbit is said to be not a path, but a lament—an unresolved cry carved across the system
- Each flare is not sound, but a memory forced into light

### 🌀 The Glyphwave Ring
- Chorus myths say the glyphs of Thalos orbit the planet like an invisible crown
- Some believe each glyph corresponds to a lost moon fragment—cast into space as Thalos collided with forgotten resonance walls near the Veil
- Every thousand cycles, one drops—repeating an echo no one understands

### 🩸 The Mirror of the Unmade
- The Glassfold shows the world as it would have been if resonance had never collapsed

### 🪶 The Core Choir
- Zhur masses in the Scar once chanted before time broke
- Now, their chant fractures with each Emberline pulse—rewriting the memory of what was, and never letting it settle
- The sound now bleeds through Aeras during Seed Phase
