# RSAD-PO007: Harenae – The Barren Harmonic World

---

## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Remounted on Harmony – Reopened after Aeras & Lighthouse Update)

### 🌍 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Harenae
- **Designation**: Resonance-Null Desert World
- **Location**: Outer Forge System, orbitally locked between Crydon and Aeras, beneath Lighthouse Spireline tether
- **Classification**: RSAD Planetary Object | Khytrium-Saturated | Drift-Dry | Tidal-Locked | Null Resonant Anchor

### 🌌 Environmental Structure
- Harenae is tidally locked, with a **sunward magma ocean** and a **frozen darkside megaocean**
- These extremes flow into the **Twilight Canyon**, a mile-deep trench where lava and water collide in rhythmic tidal surges
- Controlled **wave collisions** forge unstable **Khytrium crystal beds**, refined under atmospheric pressure and Emberline influence
- **Shield pylons** line the canyon rim—synchronized to the orbital pass of the Lighthouse, which recharges them in sequence
- The pylon network is calibrated via uplink to Aeras’ **Cradle Array**, using flare harmonics to trigger forge-phase stability
- Planet composed of:
  - **Tidevane Spiral** – wind-formed thermal gyres pulled by Aeras' orbital drag
  - **Null Channel** – global trench where all resonance cancels
  - **Shardspan Ridge** – resonance-shattered vaultplate mountains
  - **Scar Columns** – remnants of failed harmonic experiments
  - **Vault Clefts** – deeply buried anchor points used for vault-linked descent

### 🔬 RSAD Observations
- Harenae absorbs resonance—generating **anti-tone signatures**
- Khytrium deposits destabilize during Crimsun flares; growth can be induced by deactivating pylons during resonance lulls
- Surface readings confirm Emberline pulse shadows trigger Zhur-surge precursors
- Mapping is only possible during **Cradle Sync**, when Aeras’ uplink and Lighthouse arc align

### 🧠 RSID & Operational Control
- RSID maintains descent pathways tied to **Seedflow cycles** coordinated from Aeras
- Migrant miners are staged aboard the Lighthouse in the **Waiting Belt** until phase-match clearance is granted
- All automated mining is banned; arc-era tools and Linewalker descent rigs are the only permitted tech
- Surface operations timed to **Veil Phase drops** from Caelorum, allowing for pylon resets and shield window entries

### 🔐 Vault & Protocol Systems
- Vault 5: The **Cradle Anchor**, sealed beneath the canyon’s central basin
- Reactivates only during double resonance lock between Aeras and the Emberline
- Contains the Pulse Seed, theorized to regulate entire Harenae-Aeras sync field
- Vault access requires harmonic glyph triad: RSAD seal, Cradle harmonic, and Caelorum uplink trace

## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Horizon-Calibrated)

### 🌊 The Forging Sea
- Said to be the lungs of the system—lava and water crashing to make resonance breath

### 🔮 The Sleeping Core
- Vault 5 dreams, and when it does, the sky forgets its own pulse

### 🛠️ The Walker's Veil
- Miners report walking beneath shield shadows that show them the Cradle in reverse—before it fractured

### 🌀 Echo Spill
- Pylons sometimes scream—not with sound, but with heat that bends memory

## 🌀 Classification Tags
- `CANON` | `META` | `RSAD` | `RSID` | `RCD` | `LATTICE-SYNCED` | `ZHURO-FORGE` | `SEED-CYCLE` | `CRIMSON-ZONE` | `VAULT-PULSE`

## ✅ Status: Crimson-Judged | Harmony Reopened | Aeras + Lighthouse Reintegrated
Harenae now reflects its true role as the pulse crucible of the system—where lava, water, and memory are forced to coexist beneath the eye of the sky's archive.
