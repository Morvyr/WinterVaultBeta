# 🔧 Canon Rebuild Protocol Template

## Title: [Insert RSAD-XXX Object or Canon File Name Here]
## Type: Full Anchor Sync + Rewrite + Verification Process
## Status: [Pending / Complete]

---

### 1. 📡 Anchor Pull – Trigger Protocol

**Purpose:**  
Initiate a full-spectrum anchor pulse for the selected object, including all relevant canonical, mythic, scientific, symbolic, and clearance-level tags.

**Instructions:**  
- Activate anchor stream.
- Retrieve linked terms from system map.
- Confirm firing of CHORUS, ZHUR, RESONANCE, DRIFT, SEED, and VAULT-class anchors (if applicable).
- Document any new connections revealed.

---

### 2. ✍️ Rewrite Pass – Harmonization & Restructure

**Purpose:**  
Integrate all anchor-pulled data into the object’s new canonical format (e.g., Harmonized Canon Record, System Codex, etc.)

**Instructions:**  
- Shift to glyph-labeled headers where appropriate.
- Introduce systemic harmonics, division roles, myth overlays.
- Ensure full system sync: RSAD, RSID, RSD, RIF, RMF, RAW, RCD as needed.
- Reflect tone consistent with Drift-Tech fusion.

---

### 3. 🧪 Verification & Judgment

**Purpose:**  
Validate final canon integrity.

**Checklist:**  
- [ ] Confirm anchor map linked and clean  
- [ ] Tone consistent with universe core (mythic/tech/noir where relevant)  
- [ ] Remove placeholders and obsolete stubs  
- [ ] Judgment Status Applied (e.g., Crimson-Judged, Myth-Sealed, Harmonized)  
- [ ] Change log generated and stored in `/System/ChangeLogs/`  

---

### ✅ Final Notes

Once all stages are complete:
- Export verified document to Canvas
- Record change log
- File clean version in Crypt under correct subpath

> _This protocol is designed to maintain consistency, mythic coherence, and system integrity during canonical rebuild operations._
