# üå™Ô∏è Nexovar ‚Äì Depth ‚àû Stream Pull

## Planetary Object Entry
**Position**: 4th Planet from Crimsun  
**Class**: Gas Giant (High Turbulence, Sonic-Active)  
**Alias**: The Nexus (formerly The Howler)  
**Role**: Resonant Training Theater | Zhur Anomaly Epicenter | RMF-Origin World

# üî≠ CANON LAYER ‚Äì Harmonized Knowledge

## Atmospheric Composition
- Multi-layer gas stratification with variable density pockets
- Strong electromagnetic fields create persistent sonic vortices
- Host to violent, hyper-resonant jet streams
- Storm bands can be up to 4,000 km wide; winds exceed 9,000 km/h

## The Shriek Belt
- Debris ring of shattered moons encircling Nexovar
- Constantly echoes sonic bursts from Nexovar‚Äôs upper atmosphere
- Debris motion guided by resonance waves, not gravity alone
- Core moon **Lyvianne** remains intact within the belt due to harmonic damping

## RMF Significance
- Nexovar is the spiritual home and training crucible of the RMF
- Only starfighters and small vessels can traverse the belt to reach RMF training zones
- All Ranger Militant Forces undergo initiatory combat exercises in upper atmosphere hover stations

## Zhur Presence
- Gravitational anomalies near moon fragments suggest Zhur-reactive cores
- RSRD confirms harmonic pulses that sync with Crimsun and the Drift
- RSAD-EX proposes drift-locked fragment masses contain living or semi-conscious Zhur derivatives

# üïØÔ∏è MYTH FRAGMENTS ‚Äì Discordant or Speculative

## ‚ÄúThe Furnace‚Äù
- Region between Nexovar and Vaelus where resonance storms, gravitational compression, and psychic pressure converge
- Referred to as a proving ground, not a military zone
- Said to burn out fear and memory equally

## The Path of the Howler
- Meditation chamber on a magnetically locked moon shard
- Surrounded by resonance-stabilized cave air
- Initiates must endure direct sonic exposure to become Rangers

## Name Lore ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Nexus‚Äù
> ‚ÄúIt does not howl. It listens. And when it listens, it changes you.‚Äù
- Nexovar renamed from The Howler after resonance map overlaps found with The Drift
- Believed to be a bridge point‚Äîresonant or conscious‚Äîbetween Zhur signals and Forge structure

## Zhur Glass
- Fragments inside the belt flicker with internal lightning
- Can be melted and reformed into Crydon-grade shielding with trace memory retention

## ‚ÄúThe Sound of One Flame Breathing‚Äù
- A Crimson-class poem locked in the Archives implies the planet is the key to activating Forge-scale resonance networks
