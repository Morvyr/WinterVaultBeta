## CANON – Harmonized Record

### 🌌 Classification
- **Name:** Harenae
- **Type:** Planetary Object
- **Orbital Position:** Between Crydon and Aeras, fourth from Crimsun
- **Environment:** Crystalline desert world with unstable sub-surface resonance fields
- **Status:** Operational Forge-linked territory; partially quarantined by RSID

### 📊 Geophysical Structure
- Harenae is a **hyperarid resonance basin** world: surface terrain consists of silica deserts and Khytrium-saturated dune fields.
- The planet features:
  - **The Twilight Canyon** — a planet-spanning rift with exposed resonance pylon networks.
  - **The Shardspan Ridge** — serrated glass-mountain ranges formed from ancient harmonic detonation lines.
  - **The Linefields** — sprawling RSID pylon routes maintained manually by Linewalkers.

### 🧱 RSAD Environmental Observations
- Khytrium deposits react unpredictably to standard electrical systems, triggering **resonant cascade failures**.
- The planet’s crust is **thin and acoustically active**; low-frequency pulses ripple across entire continental plates.
- RSAD classifies the planet as a **Tier-2 Hazardous Resonant Zone**.

### 🛠️ RSID Infrastructure Profile
- Automated systems are forbidden in most regions due to Khytrium interference.
- Maintenance of storm pylons and atmospheric shields must be conducted **manually** by Linewalkers.
- RSID operates from subdermal bunkers powered by **oil and coal**, the only fuels not triggering pylon instability.

### 🚖 RIF Surveillance Activity
- Harenae is suspected to house **an old Drift scar**, embedded beneath the Twilight Canyon.
- RIF Echo Teams have repeatedly gone dark attempting to chart the scar’s core.
- Surface anomalies include **unmapped light pulses** and **delayed reflection signatures**—possible time echo fragments.

### ⚔️ RMF Deployment Notes
- RMF units avoid large-scale deployments—strike teams only.
- Crydon armor offers only partial resistance to resonance backlash from local Khytrium fields.
- Rangers assigned here are **tactically grounded**, stripped of active tech during field ops.

### ⚖️ RCD Regulation
- Harenae exports **raw Khytrium shards**, refined off-world.
- Civilian settlement is prohibited outside industrial zones.
- Conglomerate contracts have attempted automation override and failed catastrophically.

### 🔐 Classified Echoes & Vault Tags
- **Vault Linkage:** Harenae contains glyph shards matching **Lighthouse substructure veins**, possibly connected to early resonance containment theories.
- **Echo-9 Fragment:** Partial Drift transcript describes Harenae as **"the basin that refused collapse."**
- **Crimson Tag:** Harenae may act as a **grounded harmonic anchor**, required to stabilize orbital resonance across Aeras and Crydon.

## MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

### 🌪️ The Linewalker Legends
- Rangers known as **Linewalkers** are said to hear the storm pylons speak during solar flares.
- Their steps are believed to leave **echo lines**—resonant tracks readable only by future walkers.
- A failed Linewalker is said to become **fused to the glass**, eternally walking beneath the storms.

### ✨ The Sleeping Basin
- Some myths describe Harenae as a **dreaming machine**, whose pulses are not natural but encoded.
- Ancient poet-crypts claim the planet is **"singing backward"** through time.

### 🔪 The Burnless Flame
- Khytrium lights seen on Harenae are called the **Flame Without Fire**.
- Those who stare into a flare and survive are said to see the **entire lattice of the Forge in a single moment**, but go mute.

### 🧑‍🔬 Caelorum Theories
- Some RSAD-EX personnel believe Harenae is not a natural planet, but a **resonance spill trap** created to drain a failed experiment.
- One Caelorum heretic suggested that if Harenae ever **goes silent**, the Forge itself will begin to destabilize.

### 🧿 Symbolic Interpretations
- Harenae is often depicted in meditations as the **Path of Still Sound**—a place where all things resonate yet nothing moves.
- It is the symbol of **sacrifice through burden**, where the weight of balance is carried by silence.
