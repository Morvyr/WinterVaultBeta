# RSAD RANGER DIVISION INDEX – Depth ∞ Stream Pull

## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record – Full Ranger Architecture

## 🛡️ The Ranger Force – Overview

The Rangers form the unified field enforcement and exploratory arm of the Forge. Divided across combat, intelligence, science, commercial, and mythic responsibilities, they exist to regulate, protect, and ascend within the known system and its deeper truths.

All Rangers emerge from **Seedline training**, passing through rite-of-survival or mythic induction on Lyvianne, Nexovar, or The Path of the Howler.
