## 🌞 Canon Layer – Harmonized Truths

### 🔹 Planetary Profile
- **Harenae** is a tidally locked planet positioned between Crydon and Nexovar.
- One hemisphere is scorched by constant exposure to Crimsun ("Sunward Face"), while the opposite is frozen in darkness ("Starward Face").
- The **terminator zone** — the twilight border — houses the massive geological structure known as the **Twilight Canyon**.

### 🔹 Twilight Canyon
- A canyon encircling the entire planetary equator.
- Formed by aeons of fluid interaction between molten and frozen matter.
- Fed by waves driven by the moon **Aeras**, which sits in tight orbit, generating rhythmic tidal distortions across both liquid and magma oceans.
- Home to one of the Forge's two rarest volatile minerals: **Harexium**.

### 🔹 Shield Pylon Infrastructure
- To protect miners and researchers, a Vault-regulated **shield pylon network** was established.
- Pylons form a planetary ring-grid, receiving periodic **plasma recharges** from a high-orbit relay known as **The Lighthouse**.
- Pylons are selectively deactivated to allow new Harexium deposition during tidal surges.

### 🔹 Sociocultural Context
- Due to electromagnetic instability, all mining and infrastructure work in the Canyon is manual or arc-level.
- The region functions as a self-contained **archaic society** — populated by conglomerate laborers, deputy battalions, and nomadic traders.
- Population exceeds **2 billion**, with city structures built into the vertical cliff walls of the Twilight Canyon.

### 🔹 RSID Designation
- Controlled under DRMD oversight, but jointly monitored by RSD and DRTD for field calibration, geomagnetic anomalies, and mining analytics.

## 🌀 Myth Fragment Layer – Discordant / Speculative

### 🔻 The Breath Below
- Chorus remnants claim the Canyon is alive, its floor formed around a **breathing fault** — a pressure vent that exhales glowing gas once per lunar cycle.

### 🔻 Flamewater Doctrine
- Vault-class researchers theorize Harexium is not a native element, but **a product of magma and sea resonance collision** — described as a mineral "born from contradiction."
- The fusion zone is considered mythically sacred; no mechanized tech functions properly within it.

### 🔻 Black Ring Whispers
- Pilots in orbit report hearing distant **songlike pulses** from the canyon floor when passing over during solar convergence.
- Some claim to have witnessed glyphs forming in the ash clouds expelled during surges.

### 🔻 Ghost Pilgrims
- Rumors speak of miners abandoning their posts during lunar tide-storms, drawn into the mists — never seen again.
- Glyphs carved into tunnel walls suggest a **hidden network of resonance followers**, possibly a forgotten sect of the early Vault.

### 🔻 The Aeras Spiral
- The moon Aeras, source of tidal surges, is said to create a **spiraling energy pattern** around the canyon — described by some as a "living gyre."
- Some speculate this spiral is part of a **planetary resonance key**, linked to Zhur flow in the Drift.
