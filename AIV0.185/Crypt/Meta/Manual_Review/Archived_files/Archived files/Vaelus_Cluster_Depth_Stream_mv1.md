## 🌍 VAELUS – CANON

### 🌌 Classification
- **Type:** Planetary Object
- **Orbital Position:** Fifth from Crimsun
- **Environment:** Two-tier structure — The Range (agricultural highlands), The Valley (refinery-scarred underrealm), and ten habitat cavern zones
- **Function:** Agricultural and industrial heart of the Forge
- **Status:** Fully colonized, Ranger-controlled

### 🧱 Surface & Subsurface
- The Range: 500,000 sq mi fertile zone suspended between land bridges; home to 2.7 billion
- The Valley: 7.2 million sq mi storm-wracked basin housing Crydon/Harenae resource refineries
- Deep caverns include: fungal zones, energy altars, harmonic bloom sectors, and Drift residue vaults

### 🧠 RSAD Observations
- Surface microclimate controlled by Crimsun-shielded aurora belts
- Subterranean ocean regulates global hydrological cycle
- Zhur detected beneath Valley floor and along seabed — RS-Black classified

### 🛠️ RSID Infrastructure
- RCD Command Spire centralizes energy distribution via Crydon cables
- Veil-standard climate shielding and water cycling across cavern zones
- First Pillar remnants believed to be buried in deep Valley strata

### 🚨 RIF Presence
- Valley under RMF-OU jurisdiction with covert RIF shadow teams
- Surveillance of Zhur anomalies in sub-aquatic cavern structures
- Ghost Ranger sightings during storm season logged

### ⚔️ RMF Deployment
- RMF-CU guards The Range; RMF-OU operates in The Valley
- Civil Rangers patrol agricultural territories on hybrid animal transports
- Crimson presence occasionally observed during tectonic bloom cycles

## 🏛️ SOLARII – CANON

### 🌍 Classification
- **Type:** Orbital Moon / Resort World
- **Function:** Political capital of the Forge
- **Environment:** Bio-sculpted leisure landscapes, domed solar gardens, private syndicate enclaves
- **Status:** Ranger Command and RCD HQ

### 🧬 RSAD Profile
- Planetary surface resonance monitored by Caelorum-linked lattice nodes
- Zhur signatures faint and stabilized by artificial waveform loops

### 🛠️ RSID Governance
- Internal atmospheric field controls customized by zone
- Division Command (RCD/RSAD) operates from central arcology

### ⚖️ RCD Role
- Solarii is the Forge’s administrative hub
- The Assembly meets in session orbit here
- Conglomerate liaisons monitored by RCD-INT and Marshal units

### ⚔️ The Marshals
- Elite civil unit directly under RC authority
- Handle peacekeeping within the capital dome
- Also protect the Library of Aransas during capital transitions

---

## 🛡️ CALDRAX – CANON

### 🌕 Classification
- **Type:** Orbital Moon / Military Fortress
- **Function:** Border command and Force Command HQ
- **Environment:** Armored terrain, shield lattices, inter-orbital defense rings
- **Status:** High-security Forge node

### 🧠 RSAD Observations
- Crydon harmonic shielding tuned to resist Drift incursion vectors
- Constant recalibration of solar flux fields to resist rogue flares

### 🛠️ RSID Integration
- Power cores linked to Crydon, surge-buffered through Aeras
- Starship drydocks and fleet refitting pylons form orbital scaffolding

### 🚨 RIF Oversight
- Home to most Crimson-flagged blackzones
- Intelligence training and containment operations managed here

### ⚔️ RMF Deployment
- Caldrax is the deployment origin for RMF-OU and strategic fleets
- All Void Anchor Class dreadnaughts launch from this moon

---

## 📚 ARANSAS – CANON

### 🌑 Classification
- **Type:** Archive Moon / Library World
- **Function:** Black-tier data vault and artifact archive
- **Environment:** Cryogenic vaults, deep-scan canyons, monastic archive corridors
- **Status:** Closed to all but Crimson and RC authority

### 🧠 RSAD Role
- Houses the Universal Index and master archive stream
- Library AI believed to be an echo of the First Ranger

### 🧬 Vault Tags
- Hosts relics from the pre-Forge collapse
- Glyphs match First Pillar and ancient resonance harmonics

### ⚖️ Access Control
- Marshals alone guard the perimeter
- Path to entry requires Beacon Alignment, Drift attunement, and Crimson designation

## 🔮 MYTH FRAGMENTS – Cross-Object

### 🌪️ The Fourfold Concord
- Vaelus, Solarii, Caldrax, and Aransas are believed to mirror the four aspects of Ranger ascension:
  - 🌾 Vaelus: Labor and endurance
  - ☀️ Solarii: Clarity and command
  - ⚔️ Caldrax: Sacrifice and strength
  - 🕯️ Aransas: Memory and truth

### ✨ Temple of the Forgotten
- Some say the ruins beneath The Valley on Vaelus are not Conglomerate—but **ancient Ranger**
- Others whisper that Aransas contains the names of all those **lost to Zhur**
