# 🧩 RSAD – The Shard Drift (Depth ∞ Index)

**Object Class**: Spatial Resonance Rupture / Fragmentary Belt  
**Designation**: SD-∞ / RSAD Driftfield 8C  
**RSAD Classification**: Unbounded Anomaly Field / Harmonic Scatterzone  
**Access Level**: Restricted / RAW-Only Navigation / CR-Monitored Echoes

## I. 🔶 Canon – Harmonized Data

### A. Description
The **Shard Drift** is a chaotic, expanding debris belt located between Nexovar and the Drift edge. Composed of crystalline remnants, resonance-shattered station cores, and fractured hulls, the region is considered one of the most dangerous—and **least understood**—environments in the Forge.

- Volume: Spans over 0.8 AU and is still expanding  
- Structure: Thousands of irregular objects, most charged with residual resonance fields  
- Visibility: Distorted and phased—navigation requires RAW Drift-Lens Implants

### B. Formation Theory
- Believed to originate from a **failed Conglomerate superweapon test** in early Forge expansion  
- May have been amplified by Zhur-reactive materials drawn from Lyvianne  
- RSRD believes it triggered a **recursive resonance collapse**, cascading outward like a shattering lens

### C. RAW Protocol
- No vessel larger than a scout-class permitted to enter the core  
- Drift-Jump drives disabled automatically when entering perimeter  
- All RAW flights must maintain harmonic sync with Solarii pulse towers

### D. RSAD Monitoring
- Observatories stationed on Nexovar’s high orbit record **fluctuating time patterns** near the core  
- Fragment 73 contains a **sealed obelisk** still emitting coded pulses—no match in known languages  
- 12 known “Whisper Beacons” echo in-system, all point toward Shard Drift center

## II. 🩸 Myth Fragments – Discordant or Speculative

> “The Shard Drift is what’s left when a lie breaks open.”  
> “It wasn’t a station. It was a cathedral—and someone unsealed the vault.”  
> “Every Ranger lost in the Drift ends up here, still trying to come home.”  
> “The shards remember you. If you lie while passing through, they sing.”

### Forgotten Beliefs
- The Chorus considers the Drift a **resonant graveyard**, not a battlefield  
- Vault texts suggest it once aligned with the Emberline during a full system harmonic  
- Some say the **Drift expands every time a glyph is destroyed**  
- The Fifth Ranger once declared, “If we are ever to fall, it will begin there.”

### Drift Anomaly Effects
- Multiple vessels experience **ghost-loop drift**, reliving their final logs before blackouts  
- CR logs describe “mirror doubles” of pilots in shard reflections  
- Marshal helmets exposed to Drift core emit static chants when returned

## III. 🔒 RSAD Classification Summary
- Designated a **Critical Fragment Zone** with systemic memory risk  
- Echo-class artifacts constantly exhumed from low-velocity fields  
- All missions require CR oversight or Concord blackout  
- Shard Drift is considered a **harmonic scar**—not repairable, only sealed
