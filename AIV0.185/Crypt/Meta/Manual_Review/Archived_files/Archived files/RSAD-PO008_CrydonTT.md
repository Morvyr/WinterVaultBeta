## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Mounted on Harmony – Depth ∞ Stream Pull)

### 🌍 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Crydon
- **Designation**: Substellar Extraction World | Orbital Collapse Crust
- **Location**: Outer Forge System, orbiting near Shard Drift
- **Classification**: RSAD Mining Planet | High-Risk Tectonic Core | Khytrium Extraction Zone | FSC-Reinforced Sector

### 🪨 Structural Overview
- Crydon is a planet-scale extraction site composed of **cracked tectonic slabs** floating above a molten hypercore.
- The surface is an **artificial crust**, stabilized by **Crydon Glass pylons** that suspend terrain plates via harmonic anchors.
- Beneath the crust lies an ocean of raw **Khytrium-infused magma**, believed to be the system's deepest elemental resonance source.
- No known natural biosphere. All life operates in arcological vault cities or mid-air mining barges.

### ⚙️ RSAD Observations
- Khytrium flows are **partially autonomous**—they respond to planetary alignment and Emberline surge cycles.
- Periodic **resonant eruptions** occur when Crimsun pulse harmonics strike core lines, requiring system-wide alerts.
- Crydon Glass is a rare, translucent shielding material formed by Khytrium resonance exposure during shield collapse events.
- Planet-wide navigation requires synchronized vault beacon triangulation.

### 🏗 Infrastructure & Governance
- Entire planet is divided into **zones controlled by the Ranger Commercial Division (RCD)**.
- Vault cities are suspended in the air above unstable terrain, tethered by Crydon pylons.
- All mining activity requires licensing through RCD-L; drift-synced harvesting crews undergo resonance induction.
- A planetary shield system was once active but is now collapsed and replaced with **sector-tier pylon grids**.

### 🛰 Relation to Shard Drift & The Lighthouse
- Crydon acts as a **fixed observation post** for the Shard Drift; all long-range RSAD signals are routed through its crown relays.
- Resides within the **Drift Harmony Arc**, a resonance flow corridor that carries shard-mirror pulses across system span.
- Closely linked to the Lighthouse’s orbital command for pylon sync, flare alert triangulation, and vault descent warnings.

## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Mounted on Horizon – Stream-Calibrated)

### 🌀 The Stone That Sleeps
- It is said that the core of Crydon is not magma, but a heart of dormant Zhur
- When it beats, the planet sheds memory instead of light

### 🔻 The Vault that Fell Twice
- There is one vault that has collapsed twice—once into the core, once into time
- Its coordinates are erased every time Emberline inverts

### 🔮 The Depth Map
- Rangers believe the Drift Harmony Arc isn’t a signal corridor—it’s a map burned into space
- Crydon may be the keystone that unlocks it

### 🪶 The Flameglass Echo
- Some Crydon pylons sing in Khytrium resonance
- The echoes they produce match the Drift Choir from the lost fleet

## 🌀 Classification Tags
- `CANON` | `META` | `RSAD` | `KHYTRIUM-ZONE` | `DRIFT-HARMONY` | `CRYDON-GLASS` | `MYTHCORE` | `CRIMSON-NODE`

## ✅ Status: Crimson-Judged | Harmony-Mounted | Depth ∞ Complete
Crydon is no longer just a mine — it is a planetary conductor of system resonance, an unstable keystone between the known and the fractured. When it trembles, the Drift listens.
