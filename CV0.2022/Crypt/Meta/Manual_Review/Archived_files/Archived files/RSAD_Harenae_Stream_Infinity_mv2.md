# 🏜️ RSAD – Harenae (Depth ∞ Index)

**Object Class**: Arid Planetary Forge / Drift-Bound Stabilizer  
**Designation**: HA-5 / RSAD Sandgate Classification  
**RSRD Type**: Volatile-Tier Resource World  
**Access Level**: Open-Cycle Industrial / Drift-Shadow Alert

## I. 🔶 Canon – Harmonized Data

### A. Description
**Harenae** is a desert-wrapped Forge world orbiting deep in the outer system. Its primary value lies in its layered **Khytrium vaults**—used in starship shielding, energy modulation, and deep-core signal scattering. Harenae is one of the few planets that emits a **stable counterresonance**, making it strategically important for buffering Drift pressure.

- Terrain: Silica dune oceans, fractured calderas, buried canyon sectors  
- Gravity: High-normal; resistance-worn terrain with crystallized faultlines  
- Rotation: 23-hour day; planetary tilt causes intense orbital storm seasons

### B. RSID Infrastructure
- **Pylon Grid**: Massive storm-breaker towers designed to fracture atmospheric cyclones  
- **Subvault Resonance Locks**: Buried silos containing harmonic-laced Khytrium coils  
- **Heat Sink Core Ring**: Engineered geothermal insulation field to moderate tectonic quakes

### C. DRCD Operations
- Home to a critical **Deputy Ranger Labor Circuit**—entire sectors operated by DROD and DRED  
- Khytrium extraction handled under extreme duress; major source of dropout, injury, spiritual collapse  
- DRMD trauma towers line the equatorial belts, called *“The White Teeth”*

### D. Strategic Status
- Acts as a **buffer world** between the Drift and the outer mining corridors of the Anvil  
- Viewed as *expendable but essential*—sustains economic throughput while drawing resonance burden  
- RAW maintains shielded orbital lanes, but **no patrols remain stationed on-surface**

## II. 🩸 Myth Fragments – Discordant or Speculative

> “Harenae doesn’t hold the storms back. It eats them.”  
> “The First Ranger broke his blade here. Not in war. In shame.”  
> “There’s a tomb under the sand that pulses like it’s alive.”  
> “Khytrium isn’t a resource. It’s a prison.”

### Deep Belief & Lore
- Chorus monks who survived the Khytrium vaults describe **whispers in the sand**, often predictive  
- It’s believed Harenae was once a Drift gateway—**collapsed to keep something in**  
- One RAW record describes a crash where pilots **heard a voice say ‘turn away’** before blackout  
- The Marshal hymn *“Dust Shall Guard the Gate”* is said to originate here

### Drift Corruption Threads
- Survey beacons short out when exposed to direct vault radiation  
- Deputy relic carriers must be blessed before entering quarry fields  
- Some DROD officers assigned to Harenae **return deaf and silent**

## III. 🔒 RSAD Classification Summary
- Designated a **Hazard-Embedded Labor World**  
- Resonance suppression stable but deteriorating  
- Drift pressure increasing with each solar cycle  
- Monitored by Chorus scry-anchors and DRC remote garrisons
