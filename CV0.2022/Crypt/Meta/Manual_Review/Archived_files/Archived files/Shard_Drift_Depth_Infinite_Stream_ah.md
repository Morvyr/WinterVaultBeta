# 🪐 The Shard Drift – Depth ∞ Stream Pull

## Object Entry
**Position**: Asteroid Belt I, between Thalos and Crydon  
**Designation**: Circumstellar Belt / Magnetic Disruption Zone  
**Alias**: “The Drift”  
**Function**: Resonance Barrier | Zhur Fragment Belt | Navigational Black Zone  
**Restricted Tier**: Crimson-Level Biological + Gravitic Clearance

# 🔭 CANON LAYER – Harmonized Knowledge

## Formation
- Fragmented remains of one or more Zhur-rich moons
- Shattering event estimated 7,000–10,000 years ago
- Created volatile resonance halo between Forge inner worlds

## Composition
- Belt width: ~0.6 AU
- Material: Iron, obsidian lattice, Zhur-core fragments
- Physically sparse, magnetically violent
- All ships require tuned shielding to approach

## RSID & RMF Protocols
- No manned structures inside
- RMF-OU rite of passage: outer ring run
- Inner zone called “The Grinding Halo”
- All Forge ships banned from passing Crydon without override

## RIF & RSAD Analysis
- “The Coil”: inner resonance band emitting predictive waveforms
- Signal maps match patterns near Nexovar and Vaelus
- Only one probe (Threnos-8) reached Thalos via the Coil

# 🕯️ MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

## “The Breath That Fails”
> “The Drift is not rock. It is the voice of a thing that tried to scream and was broken.”
- Drift resonance mirrors vocal strain maps
- Regarded as a broken god-engine by ancient factions

## The Labyrinth Effect
- Outer ring behaves like a resonance maze
- Ships redirected non-physically via spatial harmonics
- Rare openings allow entry into The Coil

## Zhur Singularity Theory
- Inner core may house a living Zhur proto-entity
- Emits glow without stellar stimulus
- Compresses space-time into drifting collapse

## The Coil
> “It is the ring that waits. The gate that never opens twice the same.”
- Entry permitted only during resonance-aligned windows
- Interior is a sensorless echo chamber; survivors are nonexistent

## Civilian Protocol
- URP: All manned craft prohibited beyond Vaelus
- All unmanned entry requires dual-agency approval
- Survivors of incursion are quarantined and debriefed under Crimson protocol
