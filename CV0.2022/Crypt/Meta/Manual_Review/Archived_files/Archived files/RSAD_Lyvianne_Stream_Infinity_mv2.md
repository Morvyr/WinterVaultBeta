## I. 🔶 Canon – Harmonized Data

### A. Description
**Lyvianne** is the only intact moon in Nexovar’s orbital field, stabilized in the chaos of the Shriek Belt by a naturally occurring sonic dampening effect. It is both wild and violent—one of the most dangerous biospheres in the Forge—and sacred to all Ranger forces.

- Surface: Jungle paradise with no evolutionary plateau; hyperpredation and megafauna common  
- Atmosphere: Oxygen-rich, humidity-choked, with constant low-frequency pressure pulses  
- Subsurface: Network of unstable caverns, Zhur resonance fields, organic crystal growths

### B. Strategic Function
- Primary training ground for RMF and RIF recruits  
- Houses the Path of the Howler satellite shrines  
- Jungle acts as a living crucible for promotion, survival rites, and RCU test deployments

### C. Zhur Containment
- Zhur grows naturally in caverns—called “Resonite” by public systems  
- Emits destabilizing harmonic bleed fields  
- Subterranean crystal masses are known to grow, divide, and pulse during Crimsun flare syncs  
- Vaulted core region is sealed by CR; no personnel below Level Five clearance permitted near inner growths

### D. Structural System
- Orbitally connected to the Lyvianne Lattice: 500 modular RMF stations in light-rail formation  
- RMF and RIF command logistics distributed through the lattice for planetary oversight  
- Lattice acts as recruitment, review, training, and command zone for Forge military development

## II. 🩸 Myth Fragments – Discordant or Speculative

> “Lyvianne breathes. The trees exhale memories.”  
> “It isn’t a moon. It’s a prison for something dreaming.”  
> “The First Rangers trained here before humanity arrived. Only 33 ever survived.”  
> “The Zhur sings beneath the roots. If it reaches the surface, the Forge breaks.”

### Known Lore
- The jungle contains a near-sentient native species believed to be the last evolved fragment of a collapsed prehuman empire  
- Rangers do not attempt communication—constant guerrilla conflict is maintained as training  
- The species is under CR protection and considered sacred to the Founding  
- Vault sigils beneath the central crater link Lyvianne to both Thalos and The Drift

---

## III. 🔒 RSAD Classification Summary
- Lyvianne is a living crucible—not fully controlled, only tolerated  
- RMF, RIF, and CR forces treat it as a sacred trial ground  
- All power flows, memory uplinks, and inter-Ranger promotions route through the Lyvianne Lattice  
- The Vault Core is never spoken of outside Aeras, RAW Command, and CR conclaves
