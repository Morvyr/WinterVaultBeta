## CANON – Harmonized Record

### 🌌 Classification
- **Name:** Thalos
- **Type:** Planetary Object
- **Orbital Position:** Third planet from Crimsun, interior to Nexovar and Vaelus
- **System Role:** Transitional world between the deep-Forge and Scint Veil-bound outer ring
- **Status:** Partially quarantined / restricted RSAD access zone

### 📊 Geological Structure
- A **cracked planetary mantle** supports unstable tectonics and vast crystalline extrusions.
- Central surface features include:
  - **The Prism Fields** — vast reflective plateaus made of unknown angular lattice formations.
  - **The Glassfold** — a canyon system formed from broken resonance structures embedded in exposed crust.
  - **The Core Scar** — visible from orbit; a ringed impact zone still emitting cold Zhur pulses.

### 🧱 RSAD Environmental Observations
- Thalos has **no stable atmosphere**, only localized gravity-locked vapor zones.
- Surface storms are **prismatic** in nature—they refract light into weaponized arcs and disrupt navigational systems.
- Zhur samples retrieved from Core Scar show **highly ordered resonance filaments** incompatible with standard Forge Zhur.

### 🛠️ RSID Structural Analysis
- No known Ranger or Conglomerate bases exist on the surface—only remote relay satellites survive.
- Failed RSID expeditions report spontaneous **telemetric recursion** (sensor data folding back into itself).
- Orbiting probes detect **non-repeating glyphic patterns** etched into the crust that shift position every 11.2 hours.

### 🚖 RIF Intelligence
- Thalos is a **potential Drift Anchor Point**—early missions noted a matching waveform echo to the First Pillar.
- Black-tag Echo-44 classifies Thalos as a **possible inverted resonance source**, suggesting it reflects the Drift instead of drawing from it.
- Interference from Thalos has disrupted long-range surveillance across the Veil corridor during multiple Emberline flare seasons.

### ⚖️ RCD Jurisdictional Status
- RCD forbids mining or terraforming without Assembly override.
- RCD-INT flagged Thalos for internal review after a Conglomerate vessel went silent in low orbit for 9 minutes, then returned with **archival data from the pre-Forge era**.
- Trade licenses auto-reject any route calculations intersecting Thalos orbital influence.

### 🔐 Vault & Resonance Tags
- **Vault Linkage:** Thalos is referenced in Aransas archives as one of the **Six Worlds of Shatterbirth**.
- **Resonant Scar Theory:** A Drift event or cosmological weapon may have created the Core Scar.
- **Classified Hypothesis:** Thalos may be a **constructed resonance mirror**, meant to deflect or preserve waveform structures from an earlier cycle of the Forge.

## MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

### 📖 Echoes of the Shatterbirth
- Thalos is said to be the world that **“shattered itself to preserve the song.”**
- Myths speak of an ancient being, the **Crystal Speaker**, who sang the planet open to absorb the first scream of Crimsun.

### ✨ Prism Ghosts
- Some RMF-CU scouts claim to see **prismatic shadows** walking the fields before vanishing in daylight.
- These figures are thought to be the remnants of a **broken echo-seed** once meant to colonize resonance space.

### 🔪 The Turning Glyphs
- According to Caelorum heretics, the shifting crust-glyphs are a **countdown**.
- When aligned, they will unlock a **forgotten pathway back through the Drift**, allowing ancestral return.

### 🔮 Vaultkeeper Dreams
- Several Aransas Vault stewards have reported dream-sync visions of a **shattered sky** over Thalos.
- In these dreams, a **black lattice descends** and speaks in pulses, repeating the same phrase: *Return the chord.*

### 🧿 Symbolic Interpretations
- In poetic registers, Thalos represents **broken memory** and **the price of containment**.
- It is observed during resonance meditations as a **negative harmony** in the Forge's songline.
