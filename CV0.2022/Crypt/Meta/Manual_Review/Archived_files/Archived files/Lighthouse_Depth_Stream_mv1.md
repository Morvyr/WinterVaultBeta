## CANON – Harmonized Record

### 🌌 Classification
- **Name:** The Lighthouse
- **Type:** Orbital Megastructure / Forge Habitat Hub
- **Location:** Positioned at the inner curve of the Scint Veil, equidistant from Crydon and Vaelus
- **Function:** Interstellar transit gate, commercial core, and political crucible
- **Status:** Operational, contested jurisdiction

### 📊 Physical & Structural Profile
- The Lighthouse is a **hollowed ring-hub station** built around a resonance-tuned gravity well.
- It features:
  - **The Halo Spine** — A central traffic conduit linking seven arc-habitat sectors.
  - **The Forgeheart Core** — A power and compression chamber feeding energy from Crydon and drift-bled current.
  - **The Ring Decks** — Civil, commercial, and strategic zones divided by jurisdiction: RCD, Conglomerate, Freelance Zones.

### 🧱 RSAD Resonance Integration
- The Lighthouse is partially powered by resonance siphoning from nearby Drift filaments.
- Energy flow is regulated by **Khytrium-compression prisms** stored beneath the Forgeheart.
- RSAD teams maintain a Vault-tier sensor web attuned to **incoming waveform disruptions**.

### 🛠️ RSID Systems Control
- RSID maintains **Gate Control**, the entry and exit filter that regulates access through the Veil.
- All resonance-capable ships are required to undergo **containment lattice dampening** to enter.
- Backup systems are mechanical or analog, in case of Khytrium interference.

### 🚖 RIF Activity Zones
- The Lighthouse houses multiple RIF observation decks and shadow corridors.
- Operatives monitor:
  - Black market cargo routes
  - Conglomerate political influence
  - Nonlinear Drift signal incursion events
- RIF agents are embedded in both civil government and Conglomerate delegations.

### ⚔️ RMF Enforcement Presence
- The Lighthouse is policed by a joint RCD/RMF detachment.
- **Civil Rangers** maintain order on the public decks.
- **Strike Marshals** are deployed during transit gate lockdowns or mass-event emergencies.
- RMF does **not** maintain full jurisdiction—reliance on political arbitration is required.

### ⚖️ RCD Political Role
- The Lighthouse is the **primary trade and diplomacy node** for all factions within the Forge.
- RCD adjudicates interplanetary disputes and enforces resource licensing and export policies.
- Civil unrest and corruption are persistent issues, especially on Deck 3 (Freelancer Sector).
- RCD-INT monitors internal sabotage threats and Conglomerate infiltration efforts.

### 🔐 Vault & Strategic Tags
- **Drift Resonance Portal:** The Lighthouse is theorized to be built atop a Drift emergence node.
- **Vault Relay Point:** Several classified signal archives are stored in sublayer Vaults for data triangulation.
- **Contingency Orders:** In case of Veil collapse, The Lighthouse becomes the fallback command core.

## MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

### 🌪️ The Signalkeepers
- Some Rangers whisper of an invisible corps who guard the **last true resonance signal** hidden beneath the Forgeheart.
- These "Signalkeepers" are said to exist outside time, only appearing during system blackout intervals.

### ✨ The Shifting Reflection
- Occasionally, the Lighthouse appears to observers as **fractured** in its mirrored surface—showing configurations that have never existed.
- Some believe this indicates the station is **partially unstuck** in local causality.

### 🌌 The Starfall Tribunal
- Poetic fragments from old Caelorum logs refer to the Lighthouse as the final seat of judgment at the "end of the blaze."
- It may one day act as the place where **the last command is given** before the system resets.

### 👾 Phantom Delegates
- RIF agents claim to have encountered **delegates from vanished colonies** inside the Freelancer decks.
- These entities leave no heat signature, no logs, and never reappear—but their approvals persist in legal chains.

### 🌟 Symbolic Resonance
- The Lighthouse represents **hope bound by decay**, a station that sees all but holds nothing still.
- In meditation rituals, it is evoked as the **pivot of vigilance**, a lens through which the future shivers.
