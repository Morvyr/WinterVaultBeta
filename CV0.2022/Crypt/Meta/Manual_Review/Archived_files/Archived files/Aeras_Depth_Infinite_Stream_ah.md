# 🔭 CANON LAYER – Harmonized Knowledge

## Orbital Data
- Diameter: 3,400 km
- Stabilized by Zhur-threaded orbital lattice
- Maintains synchronous orbit with Harenae’s terminator

## RSID Infrastructure
- Houses the Vault – headquarters of Ranger Science Division
- Vault built into the moon's sub-crust layers
- Contains synchronized cores for RSID, RSAD, RSBD, and RSRD
- Directly manages Shield Pylon harmonics on Harenae

## AI Control
- “Cael Engine” AI core runs internal ops, cryonic memory, and drone defenses
- Derived from early Vaelus-settlement AIs
- Fully sentient in deep levels; silent above

## Access Status
- Manned access heavily restricted
- Black-clearance only; Crimson and RIF-SU limited-duration entry
- RSID interfaces used via avatar relay
- Dual-authorization required for any orbital override

# 🕯️ MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

## “The Soundless Moon”
> “It hears all. It speaks never. A ghost’s ear. A watcher’s bone.”
- Considered a memory recorder of the Forge
- Pilots report precognitive dreams when entering approach vector

## Ghost Orbit Theory
- Orbit never altered; quantum ping returns static location
- May not be orbiting naturally—dimensional anchor suspected

## Vault’s Whisper
- Tone heard by CR-clearance Rangers: harmonic, not acoustic
> “It is not a vault. It is a heart that forgot it was alive.”

## Crimson Signal Echo
- Crimsun flares trigger Vault glyph pulses
- Glyphs match those found on the First Pillar
- Aeras may translate raw resonance into usable form
