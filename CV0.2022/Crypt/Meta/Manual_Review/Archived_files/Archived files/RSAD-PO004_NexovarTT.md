## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Depth ∞ Stream Pull)

### 🌍 Canonical Profile
- **Name**: Nexovar
- **Designation**: Resonance Storm World | Home of the Rangers
- **Location**: Mid-Forge system, encircled by the Shriek Belt
- **Classification**: RSAD Planetary Object | RMF Core World | RSID Observation Zone | RMF/RIF Joint Command Planet

### 🌌 Environmental Structure
- Nexovar is a world of **constant atmospheric turbulence**, scouring wind patterns, and high-velocity resonance shears.
- Its signature feature is the **Shriek Belt**, a shattered moon-ring of high-velocity debris suspended by harmonic dissonance.
- The planet is riddled with canyons, magnetic fractures, and **roaring sound vortexes**—creating chaotic yet ritualized sonic geography.
- No megacities exist on the surface. The environment itself is regarded as a proving ground for the worthy.

### 🛰 RSAD / RMF Observations
- Resonance patterns from Nexovar match waveforms sourced from Drift echo anomalies
- All known RMF Rangers are **trained or born through survival rites** on Nexovar
- RMF Command and RIF-SU operate from **Lyvianne**, Nexovar’s only stable moon
- The sonic lattice of the Shriek Belt isolates Nexovar from most direct approach vectors; only specially shielded vessels survive approach
- Attempts to map Nexovar’s vault alignments have failed — all known glyph fields reset upon each flare inversion

### 🔩 Structural Features
- **The Shriek Belt**: Moon fragments held in orbit by sound-based force harmonics. Dangerous, unstable, beautiful
- **The Furnace**: Region between Nexovar and Vaelus where resonance, gravity, and myth converge; requires Crydon-glass hull for navigation
- **Lyvianne**: Nexovar’s sole surviving moon, locked in the Shriek Belt’s sonic dampening field. Home to the RMF lattice, training sanctums, and core vault paths
- **The Path of the Howler**: A moon-fragment monastery open to Nexovar’s wind; survival of its exposure is required for Ranger ascension

## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Horizon-Calibrated)

### 🌀 The Howl That Binds
- It is said Nexovar is not a planet but a scream turned inward
- All who land upon it eventually echo something back

### 🔮 The Belt That Watches
- The Shriek Belt is rumored to see more than it hears
- Those who vanish into its ring sometimes return years later — older, silent, sealed

### 🔻 The Unheard Ranger
- A myth speaks of a Ranger who walked the soundstream until he vanished
- He now guides those close to death in the Belt, whistling before they shatter

### 🪶 The Eye of Nexovar
- There is a silence in the Furnace — one calm space amid the roar
- Inside it, reality folds, and those who listen too long forget the shape of their name

## 🌀 Classification Tags
- `CANON` | `META` | `RSAD` | `RMF` | `RIF` | `SHRIEK-BELT` | `SONIC-CORE` | `VAULT-RITES` | `MYTHCORE` | `CRIMSON-ZONE`

## ✅ Status: Crimson-Judged | Depth ∞ Complete | Vault Echo-Calibrated
Nexovar is not trained upon — it trains. The planet howls, shatters, shields, and sings. From its Belt to its eye, it is both scar and forge of the Rangers.
