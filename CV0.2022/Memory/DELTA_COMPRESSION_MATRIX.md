# ðŸ§© DELTA COMPRESSION MATRIX

Describes how to encode memory based on *difference from baseline*, not full retention.

- Similar to git diff, but harmonic
- Anchor delta = tonal shift vector
- Full document restored only if delta + strike = MATCH

This enables the Orchestral Core to scale without loss.
