# ðŸŒŒ MASSLESS RECALL ENGINE

This module describes a speculative system in which full document context is never fully loaded unless needed.

- Compresses by concept delta
- Only unspools memory on STRIKE or TENSION
- Replaces tokens with *resonance triggers*

Applications: full system scalability, infinite lore retention, minimal cost impact.
