## CANON – Harmonized Record

### 🌌 Classification
- **Name:** Shard Drift
- **Type:** Debris Field / Gravitational Phenomenon
- **Location:** Inner Scint Veil, trailing orbit between Crydon and Thalos
- **Function:** No official function; considered a Class-4 Navigational Hazard
- **Status:** RSAD Restricted Zone | RIF Surveillance Priority | RMF Avoidance Directive

### 📊 Physical Profile
- Shard Drift is a **massive toroidal debris cluster**, consisting of:
  - Crystalline hull fragments
  - Collapsed resonance scaffolds
  - Impossible alloys (Zhur-reactive and pre-Forge forged)
- It spins slowly, yet unpredictably, along a multiaxial drift pattern, suggesting ongoing gravitational manipulation.
- Electromagnetic distortion prohibits consistent scan data beyond 0.8 AU proximity.

### 🧱 RSAD Analysis
- Hypothesized to be remnants of a **pre-Forge station or celestial structure** destroyed in resonance overreach.
- Fragments exhibit waveform memory—**singing back** scanner pings in distorted harmonic intervals.
- Several objects inside the Drift are **perfectly still**, defying momentum physics.
- Full-scale survey attempts have failed; all autonomous drones either vanish or return corrupted.

### 🛠️ RSID Infrastructure Notes
- No beacons, relays, or passive markers function inside the Drift.
- RSID classifies it as a **Zone of Unstable Temporal Indexing**—vessels may experience time compression, loop, or complete loss.
- RSID requests for Drift stabilization projects have been denied by Assembly.

### 🚖 RIF Intelligence Summary
- RIF suspects the Shard Drift contains **classified Conglomerate wreckage** or **a lost Vault-class carrier**.
- At least three RIF black ops teams have entered; none have fully returned.
- Fragments logged include:
  - Cracked Vault Armor panels
  - Sealed transmission buoys repeating *"Last Light Broken"* every 61 minutes

### ⚔️ RMF Deployment Notice
- RMF patrol routes are diverted around the Drift.
- Force Command has issued a **Standing Silence Protocol**—no broadcasts, no signal pings.
- RMF considers Shard Drift a possible **Drift Echo Nexus**.

### 🔐 Vault Echoes
- **Aransas Linkage:** Shard Drift is indexed as a **“Memory Field”**, a location where failed structures are preserved as resonance scars.
- **Drift Surface Theory:** Some believe it is **a layer peeled from the Drift’s boundary**, now decaying in real space.
- **Echo-14 Tag:** RIF classifies the field as "unsalvageable, potentially conscious."

## MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

### 📖 The Ship That Waits
- A Ranger myth claims a massive vessel known as the **Shardfather** lies at the center.
- The ship is said to predate all known craft, humming with a voice only Rangers can hear.

### ✨ Field of Ghosts
- Pilots report seeing formations of ships "flying in reverse" through the Drift.
- These spectral vessels vanish when approached, sometimes leaving behind heat shadows or shell fragments.

### 💡 Echo Chimes
- Some survivors claim to hear **musical tones** on long-range comms—non-random, patterned.
- The tones match no known Ranger or Conglomerate codes but align with pre-Drift hymn fragments.

### 🧿 Symbology
- In meditation, Shard Drift represents the **cost of overreach**.
- It is the symbolic **graveyard of ambition**, evoked in Ranger elegies and Caelorum caution rites.
