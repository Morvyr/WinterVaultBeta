**Object Class**: Mobile Orbital Habitat / Transit Hub  
**Designation**: STN-1 “The Lighthouse”  
**RSID Classification**: Veil-Gate Citadel  
**Access Level**: Universal Traffic Clearance / Crimson-Locked Vault Segments

## I. 🔶 Canon – Harmonized Data

### A. Description
The **Lighthouse** is the largest transit citadel in the Forge, stationed near the inner rim of the **Scint Veil**. It functions as a customs spire, diplomatic deck, and orbital hub for all traffic between the Forge and the Anvil.

- Structure: Vertical spike, 67 levels; orbital tethered to the Veil ring  
- Population: ~22 million permanent inhabitants, not including migrant traffic  
- Ownership: Officially held under RCD and RAW jurisdiction; unofficially administered by RC

### B. RSID Systems
- **Veil Stabilizer Array**: Manages flare-gap harmonics in Scint corridor traffic  
- **Dock Vault Compression Rings**: Mitigate drift pulse as starships pass through veil edge  
- **Central Obelisk Core**: Syncs with RAW flight lattice; stores resonance trails of all incoming/outgoing vessels

### C. Civil Activity
- Acts as a neutral ground between Conglomerate forces, Forge civilians, and Rangers  
- Heavily populated by **DRCD commercial labor units** and **DROD garrison squads**  
- Policed internally by **Marshals under Solarii directive**, not RCU  
- Publicly hosts RC assembly ceremonies during Veil-year anniversaries

## II. 🩸 Myth Fragments – Discordant or Speculative

> “The Lighthouse isn’t a station. It’s the last memory of a station.”  
> “You don’t dock at the Lighthouse. You’re remembered there.”  
> “There’s a level above the top floor. It only appears if you forget your name.”  
> “The Scint Veil was made to protect the Lighthouse. Not the other way around.”

### Hidden Functions and Lore
- Some believe the Lighthouse is a **memory anchor** for starship AI  
- The Chorus claims the station was built atop the remains of a Conglomerate ark that tried to breach the Veil without clearance  
- Vaults on Level 47 are sealed—rumored to house **archived drift agents** and forgotten maps  
- RAW officers who die within the station are believed to **remain in service** via trace beacon echoes

### RSAD Black Entry
- Beacon logs show time distortion around the central column during solar flare overlap  
- RIF intercepts claim the Lighthouse **transmits unregistered drift signals** once per lunar cycle  
- Marshals assigned to the upper decks are required to recite **silencing rites** before duty

## III. 🔒 RSAD Classification Summary
- Active drift relay node with partial memory bleed risk  
- No ships may linger more than 3 days docked without command override  
- Internal levels are reorganized once every Veil-year (unexplained pattern)  
- Vaults 47–52 sealed to all but CR and Chorus designates
