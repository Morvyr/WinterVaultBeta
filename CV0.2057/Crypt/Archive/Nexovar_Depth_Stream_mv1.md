## CANON – Harmonized Record

### 🌌 Classification
- **Name:** Nexovar
- **Former Name:** Carenthos (redacted)
- **Type:** Planetary Object
- **Orbital Position:** Second planet from Crimsun
- **Function:** Anomalous resonance world / RMF training origin / Sonic environmental singularity
- **Status:** Operational / Restricted Zones / Myth-bound

### 📊 Environmental Summary
- Nexovar is a **turbulent, resonance-reactive world**, characterized by:
  - Cyclonic electrical storms that never dissipate
  - Terrain sculpted by frequency — mountains shaped by harmonic interference
  - A sonic upper atmosphere that emits continuous pulses

### 🧱 RSAD Anomalous Readings
- Entire planet is a resonance map echoing **Crimsun harmonic intervals**
- Surface grid behaves as a **planet-scale audio modulator**, pulsing in tones recorded in Zhur caverns across Lyvianne
- **No dreadnaught-class ship** has ever entered orbit without hull destabilization
- Only light scouts and small fighters can enter safely

### 🛠️ RSID Infrastructure Presence
- No permanent surface outposts; limited **aero-anchor hubs** exist along stabilized ridge zones
- All hardware is **non-resonant**, low-emission
- Crydon-sourced echo towers deployed for tracking planetary fluctuations

### 🚖 RIF Classification Tags
- Nexovar is believed to be the **origin point of RMF harmony training**, embedded with subconscious triggers
- RIF-OU agents use the **Shriek Belt** for calibration of anti-resonant gear
- Classified RS-Black link: Nexovar signal matches **Drift pulses** recorded 0.6 AU beyond the Veil

### ⚔️ RMF Role and Structure
- Considered the **true home of the Rangers**
- Houses the **Path of the Howler** — a meditation trial site open to sonic exposure
- All Rangers must pass through Nexovar acoustic rites before Veil service
- RMF-OU and RMF-SU are stationed in orbit, on Lyvianne, or deployed within the Shriek Belt

### 🔐 Vault & Resonance Tags
- **Shriek Belt:** Remnants of former moons pulverized into high-velocity orbit, forming a sonic resonance ring
- **Lyvianne:** Only intact moon, stable due to debris interference acting as **natural sonic dampener**
- **Vault Signal Match:** Planet-wide pulse harmonizes with ancient Drift hymn stored in Aransas
- **Crimson Directive:** All resonance readings from Nexovar must be routed through Caelorum driftfolds

## MYTH FRAGMENTS – Discordant or Speculative

### 🔪 The Howler
- Nexovar is called "**The Nexus**" by RMF initiates, believed to be a living tone made planet
- Said to have screamed during the Forge's founding, drawing the first Rangers from cryosleep

### ✨ The Planet of Pulse
- Some believe Nexovar is **not a planet**, but a resonance object seeded in orbit to calibrate the system
- Caelorum records suggest it may be the **anchor point** of the entire harmonic mesh

### 🌪️ Ranger Ascension Myth
- The first aspirant to survive the **Path of the Howler** became the prototype for Ranger frequency attunement
- His body became glass, and his voice continues to **ring beneath the storms**

### 🌟 Symbolic Role
- Nexovar represents **resonant truth through pain**
- It is both the **trial of sound** and the **echo of legacy**
- Invoked during death rites and naming ceremonies
