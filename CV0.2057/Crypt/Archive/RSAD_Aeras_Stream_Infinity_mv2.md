# 🧊 RSAD – Aeras (Depth ∞ Index)

**Object Class**: Planetary Blacksite / Resonance Vault World  
**Designation**: AE-1 / RSAD-EX Primus Lock  
**RSAD Classification**: Planetary-Level Containment Zone  
**Access Level**: Crimson-Locked / Scholastica-Bound / Zhur-Indexed

## I. 🔶 Canon – Harmonized Data

### A. Description
**Aeras** is a cold, storm-bound planet in the outer Forge system, used exclusively by RSAD and RSD divisions for resonance research, anomaly study, and black-access containment. The surface is nearly uninhabitable, but beneath its glacial mantle lie **the Vaults**—a vast grid of subterranean halls, research chambers, living archives, and temporal stasis galleries.

- Orbit: Highly eccentric; long solar years  
- Surface: Frozen ridges, methane spires, pressure-bound oceans  
- Subsurface: RSAD Vault Complex 1–17, spanning 200km

### B. Institutional Function
- Headquarters of **RSAD-EX**, the Astrological Extension Team  
- Core facility for **RSD Scholastica** postgraduate rites  
- Base of the **Zhur Observation Program**—known publicly as “Resonite Fieldwork”

### C. Known Installations
- **Vault 1 (The Caelorum)**: The central academy and resonance induction temple  
- **Vault 6 (Chorus Echo Fold)**: Echoed song-relic chambers from Drift harmonics  
- **Vault 9 (Obelisk Chamber)**: Home to the First Glyph—believed to predate Crimsun  
- **Vault 13 (Unlit Core)**: Only accessible to CR and Fifth-Seal Marshals

## II. 🩸 Myth Fragments – Discordant or Speculative

> “Aeras is where the stars scream in sleep.”  
> “Every vault is a question. The planet only opens if you answer wrong.”  
> “Vault 17 is breathing.”  
> “It wasn’t built. It crystallized.”

### Cultural Lore
- Aeras is said to have formed as a **result of resonance backlash**, not gravitational accretion  
- Many believe the Vaults were **not dug**, but revealed—**like the peeling of skin**  
- The Chorus names it *“The Underbell”*, where the truth beneath creation vibrates eternally  
- The name Aeras appears in pre-Forge human language as “veil of wind” or “he who whispers down”

---

### RSAD Deep Access Log
- Zhur pulses recorded at Vault 6 and Vault 13 reach critical instability every 11 years  
- A harmonic thread links Vaults 1, 9, and 13—forming a triangulated “memory circuit”  
- Several CR operatives have permanently taken residence within the lower vault strata  
- Time slip has been confirmed in 4 chambers—clock variance exceeds 90 seconds per day

---

## III. 🔒 RSAD Classification Summary
- **Total planetary lockdown during Drift flare seasons**  
- Admittance requires RC triple-signet + Chorus harmonic + RAW temporal beacon  
- Zhur containment is “active but hostile”  
- Aeras is considered a living test site and **memory-stabilized tomb**
