## I. 🔶 Canon – Harmonized Data

### A. Description
**Nexovar**, once known as Carenthos, is the fourth planet in the Anvyr system. A world of violent storm belts, perpetual thunderfronts, and fractured moons, it functions as a core sonic proving ground for RAW starfighter training, resonance calibration, and Chorus initiations.

- Atmosphere: Cyclonic, high-density nitrogen-oxygen with hyperconductive particulate layers  
- Orbit: Central inner system, surrounded by the shattered Shriek Belt  
- Surface: Unreachable by large vessels; accessible only via resonance-adapted craft

### B. Moon System
- The Shriek Belt: A ring of violently colliding moon remnants  
- Lyvianne: The only surviving moon, stabilized by sonic dampening  
- Every 5–12 days, a moon fragment succumbs to Nexovar’s gravity, creating:  
  - Shockwave storms  
  - Tectonic rifts  
  - Planet-wide resonance quakes

### C. Strategic Function
- Primary training ground for RAW flight cadets, starfighter units, and atmospheric tacticians  
- Conduit world for inter-resonant weapon testing  
- Houses a rare planet-scale feedback field where sonic energy becomes spatial friction

### D. Observational Installations
- Orbiting RAW command platforms: modular, mobile  
- Surface probes are ritual-piloted or drone-escorted, never AI-guided  
- Lyvianne-linked harmonic stabilizers pulse in response to Nexovar’s cycle

## II. 🩸 Myth Fragments – Discordant or Speculative

> “It doesn’t spin. It howls.”  
> “Every Ranger who trains here leaves a scream behind.”  
> “The Second Ranger exiled herself here. The moons heard her mourning.”  
> “Nexovar isn’t a world. It’s the breath between wounds.”

### The Chorus and the Circuit
- Nexovar is sacred to the Chorus of the Hollow Storm, whose monasteries dot the inner Shriek fragments  
- These monks and nuns believe the planet sings the future  
- When a monastery fragment falls, the Chorus celebrates: “They’ve been called home.”  
- Initiates must survive open exposure to Nexovar’s sonic layer—ritualized as The Path of the Howler

### Drift Effects
- Deep resonance mapping matches sonic patterns found in The Drift  
- Zhur crystals brought to orbit fracture if unsealed for more than 3 minutes  
- Gravity shards in orbit behave as if semi-sentient, altering position during solar pulses

### Crimson Lore
- The Second Ranger founded both the Chorus and RIF from exile here  
- Nexovar was once called “The Furnace Mouth” by RAW captains  
- Rumored that the sonic storms originate not from wind—but from something bound within the core

## III. 🔒 RSAD Classification Summary
- No dreadnaught-class ship has survived entry past the Belt  
- Only Chorus-trained pilots and RAW Resonant Flight Cadre may approach inner orbit  
- Harmonic collapse is measured in decibel-coded tidal bands  
- Nexovar remains the only planetary object whose sound field has breached the Hollow Seat's glyph shielding
