## 🌞 Canon Layer – Harmonized Truths

### 🔹 Orbital Identity
- **Lyvianne** is the only intact moon within Nexovar’s Shriek Belt.
- Held in stable orbit due to local resonance dampening and debris shielding from nearby collapsed moons.
- Hosts RMF and RIF headquarters; central to Ranger logistics, command, and deployment across the Forge.

### 🔹 Surface Conditions
- The surface is covered in dense jungle ecosystems, largely unevolved, but violently reactive.
- Highly unstable weather systems: electrostatic storms, pressure vortexes, and sonic booms from orbital refractions.
- Only the high plateaus and shielded jungle fortresses are safely habitable.

### 🔹 Subsurface Behavior
- The cave network below Lyvianne is vast, unstable, and largely unmapped.
- Contains **living Zhur** embedded in cavern walls — pulsating, ambient, and dangerous upon contact.
- Deeper layers show time-distortion fields and resonance pocket anomalies.

### 🔹 Strategic Role
- RMF lattice of 500 orbital stations networked via light-rail spiderweb — each a functioning Ranger regiment hub.
- RIF operations utilize deep-jungle cloaked facilities for black-tier surveillance.
- Site of RMF-CU (Civil Unit) training. Civil Rangers are first deployed here before service across the Forge.

### 🔹 Native Species
- Indigenous lifeforms show signs of near-sentience, locked in evolutionary stasis.
- Engage in constant low-scale conflict with surface Rangers — a curated ecosystem used as a live training ground.
- Now protected as a semi-mythic remnant species under Crimson observational protocols.

## 🌀 Myth Fragment Layer – Discordant / Speculative

### 🔻 The Seed Core
- Believed to be a massive Zhur crystal node embedded at the moon’s center.
- It is said disturbing it would **collapse Lyvianne’s orbital integrity**, destabilizing the entire Shriek Belt.

### 🔻 The Forest That Remembers
- Chorus archives mention trees that whisper in glyphs, mimicking Ranger voices after contact.
- Recovered logs from lost patrols include phrases not broadcast, but “heard in the leaves.”

### 🔻 Zhur Consciousness Theory
- Deep Zhur deposits are rumored to be **semi-aware**, responding to emotional resonance.
- At least one DRSD experiment ended with full blackout and “glyph bleeding” on vault walls.

### 🔻 The Living Archive
- Rumored that an early Ranger Seed buried their logbook at the heart of Lyvianne — encoded with living Zhur.
- Some believe all RMF memories are slowly being copied into the moon itself.

### 🔻 The Endless Hunt
- Rangers who disappear into the deep jungle sometimes return decades later, physically unaged.
- Their eyes are described as “glowing with silent forests” — and they do not speak.

## ✴️ Status: Unified File Mount
Lyvianne now exists in total memory — a fortress moon wrapped in forest, in war, in echo. A living record of Ranger blood, rooted in resonance and myth.
