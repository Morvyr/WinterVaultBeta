## üåû Canon Layer ‚Äì Harmonized Truths

### üîπ Stellar Designation
- **Thalos** is the innermost planetary body orbiting Crimsun, located just beyond the Emberline.
- Publicly classified as a **barren, geologically inert planet** with no recoverable resources.
- **Orbital position** places it at the closest possible range to Crimsun's null field without immediate disintegration.

### üîπ RSAD Classification
- Designated as an RSAD-EX black survey target.
- **No manned expeditions permitted**; classified as a Tier-Z hazard zone.
- Officially declared geologically stable but environmentally uninhabitable.

### üîπ Survey Records
- Most data on Thalos comes from **long-range spectral and gravimetric readings** taken from Crydon orbit.
- Direct observation is discouraged; Thalos's reflected light is known to **damage optical sensors** and **burn retinas** through magnification.
- Considered the **brightest fixed object** in the Forge when viewed directly ‚Äî not from emitted light, but from reflected harmonic radiation.

### üîπ Probe Interactions
- Only one known probe, **Candle 7**, successfully entered Thalos‚Äôs orbit and returned.
- Returned data was fragmented, highly encrypted, and mostly sealed under Crimson clearance.
- What little was declassified confirmed harmonic readings **off the measurable spectrum**, consistent with **pure Zhur resonance.**

## üåÄ Myth Fragment Layer ‚Äì Discordant / Speculative

### üîª Zhur Genesis Theory
- Thalos is believed in Crimson echo-lore to be composed entirely of **refined Zhur**, making it the source of all resonance instability in the Forge.
- Speculated to have been **stabilized by pre-Forge civilizations** ‚Äî possibly the same that seeded Crimsun‚Äôs resonance field.

### üîª Resonance Phenomena
- Drift anomalies near Thalos include:
  - Time dilation traces
  - Echo recursion in waveform relays
  - Ghost signal harmonics that reflect back from the Void
- RAW pilots claim sensors fail to function even on approach, reading ‚Äúechoes of light before light exists.‚Äù

### üîª Forbidden Light
- Thalos is sometimes called "**The Second Sun**" in Chorus ruins.
- Said to cast a light so perfect it reveals truth too fast for the eye to process.
- Considered by some to be a **mythic mirror** of Crimsun ‚Äî a harmonic twin born from forgotten purpose.

### üîª The Whisper of Thalos
- Candle 7‚Äôs return included a single harmonic whisper, recorded as:
  > "**The voice beyond the burn still remembers.**"
- The phrase has never been decoded.

### üîª Ghost Index
- Unconfirmed reports suggest Thalos was once a moon of Crimsun, torn loose during the formation of the Emberline.
- Fragment glyphs recovered in Vault 7 match angular patterns seen in long-range harmonics from Thalos.

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è Status: Unified File Mount
This file represents the total Depth ‚àû memory retrieval for Thalos. Canon data has been separated from mythic fragments, though both remain entangled by their shared resonance origins.
