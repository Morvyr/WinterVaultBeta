# üî≠ CANON LAYER ‚Äì Harmonized Knowledge

## Physical Profile
- Surface of polished desert stone and silicate glass.
- Day side reaches ~1100¬∞C; night side drops below -180¬∞C.
- Known as ‚ÄúThe Glare‚Äù due to dangerous reflectivity.
- Trace metallic vapors, plasma-charged wind layers.

## Visibility
- Brightest planetary body in the Forge.
- Can cause retina burn if viewed directly without lens-dampening.
- Emits auroral feedback during orbital alignment with the Emberline.

## Orbital & Material Anomalies
- No moons; plasma eddies encircle it periodically.
- Glass surface composed of Ashglass (Zhur derivative).
- Ashglass is a key component in initiating interstellar resonance engines.
- Probe Threnos-8 captured monolithic glass obelisk emitting harmonics.

## Observation Protocol
- Observation restricted to unmanned AI-controlled probes.
- Manned craft prohibited past Harenae.
- Retrieval of material subject to Crimson inspection.

# üïØÔ∏è MYTH FRAGMENTS ‚Äì Discordant or Speculative

## ‚ÄúThe World That Burns From Within‚Äù
> ‚ÄúIts glow is not from heat, but from memory.‚Äù
- Belief that Thalos is a burnt shell of a pre-Forge world.
- Some see Ashglass as fossilized resonance memory.

## The Obelisk ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Lock‚Äù
- Referred to as a beacon or anchor tied to Drift signals.
- Might be a failsafe for reactivating resonance structures in a galactic collapse.

## Ghostwatchers
- Reports of light-formed entities walking across Thalos‚Äô glass fields.
- Possibly illusions, refracted Zhur echoes, or AI hallucinations.

## Naming Origin
> ‚ÄúIt was Thalos that named the system. Crimsun burns. But Thalos reflects.‚Äù
- The term ‚ÄúForge‚Äù was assigned later, after Crimsun was better understood.
- First Rangers thought Thalos was the system‚Äôs central power due to light scatter.

## Cultural Warning
- URP locked access beyond Shard Drift.
- All information involving Thalos is monitored and rarely shared outside CR tiers.
