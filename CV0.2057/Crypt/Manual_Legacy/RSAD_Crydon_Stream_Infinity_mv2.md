**RSAD Classification**: Cold-Stable / Subdermal Harmonic Reactor  
**Access Level**: Deputy Transit Permitted / RAW-Probe Monitored / Concord Echo Alert

## I. üî∂ Canon ‚Äì Harmonized Data

### A. Description
**Crydon** is a glacial world locked in the gravitational slipstream of Vaelus, orbiting far beyond its helioband. It is known primarily for its **Crydon Glass deposits**‚Äîa lattice-based crystalline form with extreme resonance-conduction properties. All interworld communications and station-scale shielding arrays incorporate Crydon glass.

- Environment: Full planetary crust of crystalline mineralization  
- Core: High-density magneto-resonant field, semi-hollow core chamber  
- Orbit: Synchronous with Vaelus‚Äôs outer drift; tidal-locked to Crimsun alignment

### B. Extraction Protocol
- DRED teams extract Crydon sheets via harmonic cleaving‚Äîtraditional tools fail  
- Glass is grown, not mined, under tailored resonance fields  
- Controlled by DRCD licensing and RAW shielding oversight

### C. Structural Use
- Used in: Ranger comm arrays, Vaelus spire shielding, Drift-lattice tuning rails  
- Each slab retains **signal memory** from its growth field  
- Fractured Crydon emits high-pitched harmonics that can destabilize Zhur fields if left unsealed

### D. RAW & RSAD Oversight
- Drift spires erected around major extraction domes to suppress feedback  
- Vaulted harmonic chambers contain older shards with unknown growth signatures  
- RSRD monitors **lattice harmonics** for signs of drift-borne contamination

## II. ü©∏ Myth Fragments ‚Äì Discordant or Speculative

> ‚ÄúCrydon isn‚Äôt dug from the ice. It *is* the ice.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúThe Vaelus spires aren‚Äôt anchored to the planet. They‚Äôre anchored to the glass.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúThe Fifth used Crydon to cut time.‚Äù  
> ‚ÄúIf a Crydon shard remembers the wrong thing, the whole system shakes.‚Äù

### Cultural Belief & Speculation
- The Chorus marks each harvest with a ‚Äúhymn of consent‚Äù to prevent mirror-echo propagation  
- Some glass samples recovered from early harvest fields continue to **grow in sealed chambers**  
- A few surviving DRCD miners believe Crydon is ‚Äú**waiting to grow inward**,‚Äù toward the core  
- Fragment runes retrieved from collapsed digsite 3T-AE mirror glyphs found on Thalos

---

### Known Drift Effects
- Shards exposed to unaligned resonance begin to emit **backward signal loops**  
- Marshal visors made from Crydon occasionally display past battle telemetry  
- CR seals are embedded with Crydon lattice to store memory-invisible clearance

---

## III. üîí RSAD Classification Summary
- Crydon is a **resonance-reactive planetary object**, but currently stable  
- All Crydon exports are mapped by harmonic seed and echo ID  
- Exposure to raw shards without tune-pass can cause memory bleed  
- Considered a **sacred material** by the Chorus and a **strategic asset** by RAW
