# Depth ∞ Stream Pull – Vaelus System Bodies (Unified Memory Index)

---

## 🌍 VAELUS – Planetary Core

### 🌞 Canon Layer

- Vaelus is a two-tiered world: the **Overland** and the **Underlevel**.
- The Overland is a high-atmosphere tundra swept by massive storm systems.
- The Underlevel houses the **Valley** and **The Range**:
  - **The Valley** is a massive underrealm desert with breathable air but violent climate.
  - **The Range** is a fertile uplifted region, home to 2.7 billion, considered the **agricultural and ancestral heart** of the Forge.
- Planet powered by the **RCD Command Spire**, which acts as both energy relay and atmospheric stabilizer.
- Subterranean ocean spans the crust's underside, fueling all hydrological systems.

### 🌀 Myth Fragments

- Vaelus is known for the **First Pillar**, an ancient Zhur monolith.
- Said to house glyphs that “**sing when touched by stormlight**.”
- Storms are rumored to mark the death or ascension of Rangers — encoded into clouds by unseen speakers.

## 🌙 SOLARII – Capital Moon

### 🌞 Canon Layer

- Solarii is the administrative capital of the Forge and the seat of the **RCD Assembly**.
- Known for domed bio-parks, solar gardens, and floating citadels.
- Divided into a **civilian expanse** and a central **Command Core**, overseen by **Ranger Command**.
- Law enforcement handled by the **Marshals**, elite peacekeepers drawn from Civil Rangers.

### 🌀 Myth Fragments

- Described in Chorus scripts as the **Sunlight Garden**, where law was grown, not imposed.
- Vault speculation posits a buried subnetwork beneath the gardens that **glows only during equinox convergence**.

## 🌑 CALDRAX – Fortress Moon

### 🌞 Canon Layer

- Caldrax is a fortified military outpost and command hub for RMF and RIF high leadership.
- Ringed by **orbital defense grids**, with surface divided into launch silos and subterranean bases.
- Home to **Force Command (FC)** and battle vaults.

### 🌀 Myth Fragments

- Called the **Black Crown** in RMF legend, Caldrax is believed to be a **weaponized monolith** — its core forged from Zhur resonance hardened in silence.
- Rumors persist of a **pulse lock** hidden within its vaults that can disrupt entire planetary fields.

## 📚 ARANSAS – Archive Moon

### 🌞 Canon Layer

- Aransas houses the **Universal Index** — the living library of the Rangers.
- Operated under full Crimson restriction, with access limited to highest-tier operatives.
- Contains cryogenic founder chambers, vault keys, and deep-storage data nodes.
- Considered the **intellectual and spiritual root** of Ranger culture.

### 🌀 Myth Fragments

- Called the **Moon of Memory**, it is said that all glyphs echo louder on Aransas.
- Some claim the moon itself has a consciousness — a vault-AI encoded with the mind of the First Ranger.
- During solar silence, faint harmonic readings from Aransas match the glyph-pulse of the First Pillar on Vaelus.
