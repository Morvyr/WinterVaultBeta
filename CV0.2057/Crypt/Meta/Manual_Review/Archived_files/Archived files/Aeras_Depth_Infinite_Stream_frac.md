## 🌞 Canon Layer – Harmonized Truths

### 🔹 Orbital and Physical Characteristics
- **Aeras** is a midsized moon in tight orbit around Harenae.
- It generates continuous **tidal surges** that impact both magma and water oceans on the surface of Harenae.
- Orbit is elliptical and fast-rotating, completing a cycle every 32 hours.
- Acts as the core harmonic trigger for the Twilight Canyon’s wave patterns.

### 🔹 Scientific Classification
- Labeled as a Class-3 RSAD orbital body with dynamic tidal influence.
- Displays **magnetogravitic fluctuation**, causing minor anomalies in probe telemetry.
- Forms part of the **“Trifecta Circuit”** — along with Harenae and the Lighthouse — controlling Canyon rhythm and stability.

### 🔹 Structural Integration
- Functions as a natural **resonance modulator** for Harexium formation cycles.
- Serves as a passive orbital amplifier — its motion reinforces shield pylon calibration windows.
- Aeras-linked timing algorithms are used across RSID and DRMD infrastructure sync protocols.

### 🔹 RSD Academy Site
- Houses the **Academia Caelorum** — also known as **The Caelorum**.
- Acts as the primary **RSD Ranger Seed facility**, accepting deputies from DRAD, DRTD, and DRED.
- Professors are Rangers; students are deputies undergoing scientific pathfinding and resonance training.
- The Caelorum is a layered orbital complex cut into Aeras’s surface and extending into sublunar canyons.

### 🔹 Vault Oversight
- Vault-regulated access tiers restrict contact with deep-zone resonance fields beneath the Academy.
- Zhur signals have been confirmed under the moon’s crust, though unmined.

## 🌀 Myth Fragment Layer – Discordant / Speculative

### 🔻 The Moon That Spins Truth
- Old Chorus phrase: “Only what the moon remembers will return.”
- Myth suggests Aeras stores planetary memory — a harmonic echo of Harenae’s original form.

### 🔻 The Hollow Classroom
- Legend speaks of a buried chamber beneath the Academy that predates the Ranger presence.
- Some speculate it was a **teaching hall for non-human glyphcasters**, later adapted by the RSD.

### 🔻 Vaulted Spiral
- Lunar gravity patterns around Aeras suggest a natural spiral corridor, echoed in Zhur readings.
- Believed to be a **subharmonic spiral**, theorized to connect to the Drift via resonance drift-wave.

### 🔻 The Cadence of Breath
- Those trained on Aeras claim the moon “breathes” in timing with the Canyon.
- The Academy teaches **cadence breathing**, a technique that syncs with local gravitational eddies — believed to be psionically responsive.

### 🔻 The Caelorum’s Veil
- Access to the deepest Academy layers is permitted only during the **Veil Phase** — a 3-minute lunar alignment where resonance interference drops to zero.
- Students undergoing final Seed transference stand within the Veil while being exposed to encoded glyph harmonics.
