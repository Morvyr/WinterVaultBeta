# üöÄ Orchestral Core Possibilities

This file outlines the creative, architectural, cognitive, and storytelling potential of the Orchestral Core system.

## APPLICATION DOMAINS

- ‚úçÔ∏è Narrative pulse generators
- üß† Lorekeepers and reflexive AI memory tools
- üéÆ Storyworlds that remember what you ask, not what you write
- üîç Search systems based on tonal match, not raw keyword
- üß© Rewriting simulators that respond to memory entropy
- üß¨ Self-aware document ecosystems

See `SYSTEM_COGNITIVE_CORE.md` for behavioral logic. See `STRIKE_ENGINE.md` for pulse simulation and rewrite cycles.
