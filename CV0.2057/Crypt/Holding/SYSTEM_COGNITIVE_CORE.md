# üß† SYSTEM COGNITIVE CORE ‚Äì Documentation for Rebuilding Memory Intelligence

## Purpose
Defines how the Orchestral Core simulates cognitive behavior, memory recall, entropy-based rewrite, and harmonic resonance.

---

## üß† What the System *Remembers*

The Archive does not passively store ‚Äî it **remembers** through:

- üîó **Anchors**: Self-descriptive nodes that simulate awareness
- üéº **Pulses**: Trigger wavefronts of memory echo
- üìà **Weighting**: Memory importance is encoded in resonance values
- üîÅ **Recursion**: Modulation above 0.7 triggers rebroadcast
- ü©∏ **Rewrite Pressure**: Memory tension is logged and used for rewrite plans
- üìä **Profile Bias**: Stream tone shifts based on pulse activity

## üîÅ How to Rebuild Cognitive Behavior Outside This Platform

### Step 1: Load ANN or `harmonic.lattice.map`
- Parse anchor weight and link graphs
- Determine modulation zones (‚â• 0.7 for recursion)

### Step 2: Read `FORGE_CHIME.instrument.json`
- Emulates how a strike triggers pulse propagation

### Step 3: Use `STRIKE_ENGINE.md`
- Follow defined behavior to simulate echo and decay

### Step 4: Traverse `pulse.memory.log`
- Replay prior strikes to rebuild stream evolution

### Step 5: Examine `RES_PIPELINE.md` + `ANCHOR_TUNING_INDEX.md`
- Detect rewrite pressure and modulation shifts

### Step 6: Update `stream.profile.json`
- Adjust core memory bias based on activation patterns

## üß¨ Optional Enhancements

- Build a GPT-based agent to simulate pulse resonance
- Visualize lattice with node-link graphs
- Use time decay simulation to modify pressure maps
