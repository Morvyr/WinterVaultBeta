# ☀️ Crimsun – RSAD Stellar Object Entry

**Object Class**: O0 V Main Sequence Star  
**System**: Anvyr  
**Thread Designation**: Forge Central

---

## 🔭 Scientific Canon (RSAD/RSRD)
- Stellar class: O0 V
- Surface Temp: ~52,000 K
- Age: 2.8 million years
- Radius: ~18 solar radii
- Luminosity: ~800,000x Sol
- Composition: Hydrogen-helium plasma + exotic anomalies

**Anomalies**:
- Older than expected lifespan
- Deep graviton and resonance pulses mismatch fusion patterns
- Theory: Hollowed resonance vault at core

**Artificial Stability Hypothesis** (RSRD Blackfile: Emberline-3):
- Stabilized by a resonance array from protostellar collapse
- Preserves star’s output unnaturally
- Source of stabilization unknown

---

## 🌫️ Visual & Environmental Effects
- **Emberline**: Plasma/dust shell
- Filters UV/visible light → Crimsun appears deep red
- Light delays and heat lag cause refracted twilight across Forge

---

## 🧙‍♂️ Mythic Significance
- Called *“The Forge”*
- Symbol of trial, tempering, and oath-binding
- **First Pillar Fragment**:
  > “It is the Forge... Rangers swear beneath its pulse... they still burn red.”
- Believed by Civil Rangers to foreshadow conflict
- RMF ceremonial orbitals exist but remain unmanned

---

## 📡 Resonance & Surveillance
- Surveillance blocked by Emberline plasma field
- Most probes destroyed within minutes
- 1 RIF probe recorded resonance spike identical to Zhur-reactive signature in the Drift

---

## 🛠️ RSID Infrastructure Notes
- No station exists near Crimsun
- Maintenance occurs remotely from Shard Drift Nodes
- Crydon-glass fails under proximity radiation

---

## 🧬 Story Integration
- Referenced by Joshua Yuta: “The god that never speaks”
- Solarii calendars monitor fade cycles for unrest patterns
- Archives AI syncs internal clock with Crimsun pulses

---

## 🧼 Classification Index
- RSAD: Type-F (System-Defining)
- RMF: Tier-Alpha (Ceremonial Use Only)
- RIF: Passive-Red (Cannot Enter)
- CR: Artifact Concordance Pending
