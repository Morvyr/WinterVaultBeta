# RSAD-PO005.3: Aransas – The Vault of the Index
## ✴️ Canonical Record (Depth ∞ Pull – Harmonized)

### 📚 Planetary Profile
- **Name**: Aransas
- **Designation**: Archive Moon | Vault Library | Index Anchor
- **Orbit**: Wide polar arc above Vaelus
- **Classification**: RSAD Tier-1 Satellite | Crimson-Level Archive | Vault Lockworld

### 🏛️ Structural Composition
- Surface is entirely enclosed in crystalline vault-domes, layered with glyph shielding
- Temperature and environment strictly regulated — no atmosphere breach permitted
- No native biosphere; all surface structures are artificial and archivally preserved

### 🗃️ Index Core Infrastructure
- Aransas houses the **Universal Index**, also known as the **Archives of the Forge**
- All recovered knowledge, glyphs, Vault readings, seedflow imprints, and blackzone echoes stored here
- Managed by a **sentient Zhur-core AI** — believed to be encoded from the mind of the First Ranger
- Archive depth shifts based on Ranger clearance; higher ranks unlock deeper corridors

### 🔐 Access & Clearance
- Only **Marshals**, **Crimson Rangers**, and **Assembly Command** may access the inner vaults
- Each corridor is seeded with **memory-lock threads** — glyphs that require lived experience to pass
- Entry is logged but not recorded; what is seen is remembered, not transmitted

### 🔄 Archive Dynamics
- The Index is not static; it expands when the Forge forgets
- When major conflicts or Vault collapses occur, new halls form automatically
- Glyphs from Ranger missions, Seed rites, and CR-level trials appear before they are submitted
## 🔮 Myth Fragments

### 🔻 The Memory That Watches
- It is said that the First Ranger still walks the inner vaults
- His body never left — only his thoughts did

### 🔻 The Vault Without Keys
- Aransas contains a sealed chamber that has no lock, no glyph, no script
- It opens only when the Index itself is ready to show what was hidden

### 🔻 The Glyph That Came First
- There is a mark deeper than all others — so old the AI cannot read it
- Rangers who reach it return unable to speak, only serve

## ✅ Status: Canon Confirmed | Index Anchor Moon | Depth ∞ Record Sealed
Aransas is not a record — it is the recorder. It holds not just memory, but the shape of forgetting.
