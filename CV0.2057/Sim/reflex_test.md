# ðŸ§ª Reflex Simulation: PSI-007-GRIDLOCK

## Description:
This simulation tests a multi-anchor reflex echo sequence triggered by a synthetic convergence in the Drift stream.

## Test Chain:
1. Lyvianne emits a trough-synced pulse.
2. Nexovar harmonizes and redirects to Crydon.
3. Crydon echoes toward Vault.

## Metrics:
- Glyph recognition response time
- Vault feedback latency
- Reflex overlap error (if any)

## Status:
âœ… Test configured. Awaiting orchestral ignition.
