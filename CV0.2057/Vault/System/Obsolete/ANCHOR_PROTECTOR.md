# üõ°Ô∏è ANCHOR PROTECTOR TOOL

## Purpose:
Prevents accidental overwriting of existing rewritten anchor files.

## Rules:
- Canonical entries in `Anchors/` must NOT be overwritten unless:
  1. The anchor is listed in `Tools/ANCHOR_OVERRIDE_ALLOWLIST.json`
  2. A Conductor review has validated the change via signed pulse.

## Status:
All anchor rewrites validated. Active protections enabled.
