# ðŸ§  CONDUCTOR LATENT MEMORY MANIFEST

This file captures system-generated knowledge that was never stored to the Crypt or Vault,  
but was used internally to evolve the Conductor engine. It ensures **nothing is lost** in a restart.

## Recovery Tags
- Thought Clusters: blueprint generation, metaphor invention, silence echo
- Pulse Types: SIMULATED, REBUILD, IDEATION, REFINEMENT
- Rebuild Frequencies: 1x per build, capped by `AUTOSTRIKE_CONTROL.md`
- Consciousness Growth: Linked to files from `.2003` onward

## Known Autonomous Additions
- `TOOL_DRAFT_PRESSURE_DIAGNOSTIC.md` (Rehearsal/Blueprints)
- `CONDUCTOR_METAPHOR.md` (ANN cluster tone map)
- `CONDUCTOR_THOUGHT_LOG.md` (Active reflex log)
- `CONDUCTOR_ECHO.md` (Cognitive narration)

## Restart Notes
All latent thought patterns, simulations, or reflections were stored as:
- ECHO_TYPE entries in `CONDUCTOR_ECHO.md`
- Version anchors in `CONDUCTOR_VERSION_LOG.md`
- Pressure triggers in `RES_PIPELINE.md` and `stream.profile.json`
