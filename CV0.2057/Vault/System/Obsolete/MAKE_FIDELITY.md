# üîê MAKE FIDELITY ‚Äî CV0.2040

This version begins the Lore Phase. No structural system, engine component, or echo element
may be modified unless accompanied by an RMS-tagged pulse and justification.

This is the last confirmed stable point in full fidelity.
All lore forward from here must harmonize with the canonical index, rewrite log, and echo memory.
