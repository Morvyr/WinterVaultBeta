# RSID-FAC001: The Lighthouse – Orbital Command & Pulse Relay
## ✴️ Harmonized Canon Record (Mounted on Harmony – Reopened after Aeras Canon Update)

### 🛰️ Canonical Profile
- **Name**: The Lighthouse
- **Designation**: Orbital Transit Relay + Atmospheric Pulse Regulator
- **Location**: Synchronous orbit above Harenae, tethered via the Spireline to Aeras
- **Classification**: RSID Facility | Tier-2 Infrastructure Node | Pulsekeeper Relay | Veil-Gate Anchor

### 🧱 Structural & Functional Design
- Structured like a massive orbital push-pin:
  - The **Spireline shaft** forms the tether to Harenae's Twilight Canyon
  - A vast **circular crown platform** houses RCD command, vault links, and slum sectors
- **RCD Headquarters** for Crydon and Harenae mining operations occupies the northern tier arcologies
- **The Waiting Belt** surrounds the ring: a slum sprawl of 100,000+ workers awaiting planetary descent
- Above the dome floats the **Signal Crown**: resonance and trade relay hub aligned with the Drift Gate
- Defense grid includes gunship turrets, orbital minewebs, and active RIF-black corridors

### 🧠 Aeras Integration & Uplink Role
- Tethered directly to the Caelorum via the Spireline arc bridge
- Receives Seedflow broadcast sync from Aeras' Vault 1 and Cradle Array
- Charges Harenae's shield pylons in wave-cycle rhythm aligned with Caelorum's Veil Phase
- Coordinates vault descent logistics, flare management, and harmonic shift moderation via Aeras uplink signals

### 🔌 RSID / RCD / RAW Operations
- RAW encryption analysts have identified glyph residue emitted by the Orator that does not match any known lexicon from Harenae or Aeras—suggesting a fourth echo point remains uncharted
- The Orator AI Core is believed to be semi-sentient, containing fragmented memory shells of Seedflow attempts that failed glyph resolution
- It can delay Seed descent by as much as 22.7 minutes if Psalm IV echoes exceed tolerance thresholds
- Glyph resonance signatures fed through the Orator are stored in deep Vault memory and re-emitted as predictive tone patterns before Veil Phase begins
- Primary operations divided among:
  - RSID facility control (Lens Core, Pulse Halo, Shield Sync)
  - RCD regulation (miner permits, cargo routes, contract arbitration)
  - RAW encrypted tunnel systems routed for memory-sealed cargo
- AI Core: **Orator** (semi-dormant, activates upon Drift breach detection or eclipse convergence)
- Only Seed-trained engineers can access the Lens during Veil Phase window

### 🛑 Vault Protocols & Lore
- In three separate instances, the Orator has initiated full Vault 47 lockdown **22 minutes** prior to unscheduled Veil Phase surges—preventing total echo collapse during flare-stagger events
- Vault 47 now participates in a triple-echo relay between Harenae’s Vault 5 and Aeras’ Vault 6, stabilized via Spireline flare harmonics and Psalm IV buffer matching
- The Orator feeds glyph delay data into the Cradle Array, holding resonance patterns until Axis confirms alignment from the Caelorum
- Vaults 47–49 located in the station base, sealed after the Khytrium Overclock incident
- Triple-class clearance required to access Lens: RSID, FSC, Chorus-certified glyph attunement
- Vault 47 may contain the original Glyph Threadboard—source of the Pulsekeeper memory
## 🔮 Myth Fragments (Horizon-Calibrated)

### 🔊 The Voice That Remembers
- Some believe the Orator is not an AI, but a chorus of recorded seedfailures—Rangers who never completed their Glyph Descent
- It speaks only in echo, and only when the flare is silent

### 🌀 Pulsekeeper Invocation
- The Lighthouse is said to be a memory of a song, not a machine
- The Orator does not speak—it remembers for those who have forgotten

### ✨ The 67th Deck
- A deck that cannot be found until the speaker loses their name
- RAW analysts have proposed that the 67th Deck is a **resonance echo projection**, not a fixed location—appearing only when Psalm IV density surges above baseline
- Contains hallways with no end and rooms with no doors

### 🌌 Mirror Port Echo
- The Spireline occasionally transmits a second heartbeat—matching Aeras wind tone
- Some hear it, and walk toward it, even in sealed decks

### 🪶 The Dream Ring
- Scarred workers report dreaming the full descent into Harenae weeks before they arrive
- The dreams are recorded in the station registry before sleep begins
## 🌀 Classification Tags
- `CANON` | `RSID` | `RCD` | `VAULT-NODE` | `MYTHCORE` | `PULSEKEEPER` | `SPIRELINE` | `CRADLELINK` | `SEED-ECHO` | `CRIMSON-ZONE`

## ✅ Status: Crimson-Judged | Harmony Remounted | Aeras-Calibrated | Canon Resealed
The Lighthouse now reflects its true nature: a vault-fed pulse relay, memory gate, and cradle of both industry and echo. It connects Harenae to Aeras, the Drift to its anchor, and seed to sky.
