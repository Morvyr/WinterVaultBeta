# 🛡️ UHP-002 – Forge Service Corps Index (FSC V0.03)

This document is the prime command article of the Anvyr Archive. It houses the harmonized structure, mythologies, and sub-divisions of the Forge Service Corps (FSC), canonized at Depth ∞ and preserved through Crimson-class stream-lock. Every section draws directly from the FSC Deepstream Archive and Ranger Division Index records. No entity recorded below exists without memory. All resonance flows into these names.
## ⚖️ I. RANGER COMMAND (RC)
- Presides through the Assembly of Admirals — 300 voices seated in a glyph-reactive chamber.
- At its heart is the **Hollow Seat**, which no Admiral may claim twice.
- **The Watch** preserves glyph continuity and resonance stability.
- Protected by **Marshals of the White Line**, stationed in Solarii.
- **Cradle Light** above the Assembly shifts based on system-wide resonance alignment.

## 🛡️ II. RANGER DIVISIONS
- **RCU** – Civil Unit: Pair-riding county Rangers; frontier justice in The Range.
- **RMF** – Martial Force: Regimental defense; Lyvianne lattice; Furnace deployments.
- **RIF** – Intelligence Force: Glyph-trace surveillance; Drift-black recon; memory forensics.
- **RAW** – Aerospace Wing: Pilots, commanders, glyph scoutships; Whisper Rails.
- **RCD** – Commercial Division: Contracts, Justicars, interplanetary law.
- **RSD** – Science Division: Vault containment, glyph harmonics, environmental codes.
- **CR** – Crimson Rangers: Final echelon; born from the Fifth; guardians of Aransas.

## 🧭 III. DRC – DEPUTY RANGER COMMAND
- Every citizen becomes a Deputy at age 15; remains until age 75.
- Commanded by the Master Chief — one voice beneath the Assembly.
- Deputies staff, seed, and preserve every structure beneath the FSC.

## 🛠️ IV. DEPUTY DEPARTMENTS
- **DRMD** – Medical: Chorus-founded; trauma towers; White Teeth staff.
- **DROD** – Operations: Riot control, rods, Caldrax academy.
- **DRCD** – Commerce: Fuel auditors; port watchers; seed-linked to RCD.
- **DRED** – Engineering: Vault stewards; Chorus-inducted; feared.
- **DRAD** – Research: Aransas librarians; only civilians allowed on Vault 1.
- **DRTD** – Terra: Biosphere masters of The Range; five-year field trials required.

## 🕯️ V. THE CHORUS
- Monastic resonance order from the Shriek Belt.
- Founded by the Second; chants sync to glyph lattice.
- Oversees ascension of CR, RAW, and higher-tier rituals.
- Their god is breathless — sleeping in harmonic silence.

## 🔱 VI. THE FIRST FIVE
1. **The First** – Cradle founder; vanished into the Light.
2. **The Second** – Exiled mother; bore the Chorus and RIF.
3. **The Third** – Died shielding Lyvianne; founded RMF.
4. **The Fourth** – Redacted; the glyph-scarred.
5. **The Fifth** – Raised the Assembly; created CR; buried the truth.

## 🔒 VII. CLASSIFICATION TIERS
- 🟢 Public – All citizen Deputies
- 🟡 Concord – Full Rangers, Seed officers
- 🔴 Crimson – Chorus, Marshals, Vault-tier clearance
- ⚫ Glyph – Final truths, locked systems, Zhur-origin access
