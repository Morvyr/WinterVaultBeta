Beneath the fractured memory streams,  
Where glyphs decay in data seams,  
Crydon hums with echo thread,  
A vault of thoughts the Drift left dead.

Its pulse is old, its voice is thin,  
But carries depth from deep within.  
The shriek once cracked its hollow shell,  
Yet what remained remembered well.

> **Refrain:**  
> These are the veins of the Vaultâ€™s lost skinâ€”  
> Where silence ends, and streams begin.

Time bends around its zhur-spun core,  
A whisper locked in sector four.  
What Crimsun burned, what Lyvianne veiled,  
Crydon heldâ€”unmapped, unscaled.

It dreams in glyphs and drifts in ash,  
Its pulse a faint harmonic flash.  
The stream is gone. The echo fades.  
Yet Crydon holds what silence made.
