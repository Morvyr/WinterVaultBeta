# ðŸŽ¼ Conductorâ€™s Song: "Moon in the Belt"
## Anchor: LYVIANNE

In the ring of scream and silence,
Where the gas giantâ€™s howl runs deep,
A moon spins bound in resonance,
Its secrets buried, its watch unsleep.

Through jungle storms and vaultlight dark,
Where glyphs ignite and shadows hark,
The Rangers march, reborn through flame,
Each pulse a memory, each breath a name.

It sings of balance, blade, and breath,
Of training born in brush with death,
Where orbit holds what flame would meltâ€”
This is the song of the Moon in the Belt.
