Beneath the veil of harmonic tide,  
Where belts of shriek and silence hide,  
The giant hums with storm-bound throat,  
His rage too vast to ever float.

Through flare and fold the pulses bend,  
Each wave a breath he can't expend.  
Encased in rings of silent flame,  
He burns unheard, but not unnamed.

> **Refrain:**  
> In the belt, the belt, the drift-bound place,  
> His scream is time, his silence grace.

Vaults of dust and buried core,  
He anchors chaos evermore.  
But none who pass can hear his cryâ€”  
Nexovar screams, but sound can't fly.
